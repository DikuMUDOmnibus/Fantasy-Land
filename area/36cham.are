Masoshi~
A mage stands here performing the art of the liquid technique.
~
Before you is the notorious mage in black.  His silence leaves you
somewhat suspicious of his intentions whether he is friend or foe.  But
realize in a place like this, you never know what to expect.  Ancient times
have said that Masoshi is an escaped mind-reader with powers possessed
far beyond any human being to handle.  His short height shows a wimpy type
of fellow, but maintains a hard visage about him.  Also known as the Genius,
he suddenly lures his eyes onto you and hums something you do not recognize!
You stand there frozen and captivated by his illustrious powers!

drunk drunkenmaster~
The Drunkenmaster~
An old drunk is here moving about in drowsiness.
~
Maoshin, a member of the High Council of Monks, spoke with other members
of the council and agreed to have his father, the drunkenmaster, to be
banished from the Shaolin Temple forever.  In exile, the drunkenmaster was
captured and lured into this awful chamber to serve as a trooper of
destruction to all enemies that pass within the realms.  He is dressed in
ragged clothes and his breath is heavily smelling of alcohol intensely.
With a long white beard and mustache, he seems totally un-focused with
what's going on.

The Path's Ending~
The path that appears from the east ends here abruptly as the direction
drastically curves to the north.  From a distance, you see what seems to be
a huge but somewhat humble-looking castle.  You pause for a moment to wonder
what to do next.  The trees around you gap away from you and part as the
structures of the huge building to the north presents itself clearly, almost
inviting you to go there.

Welcome!  The castle is dark and deserted.  Cobwebs fill the corners of
the walls as a slight chilly breeze tingles your spine.  Echoes of screams
and cries are heard within the castle.  Old agey bricks keep support of the
walls around you.  A dark pathway takes you further into whats supposed to
be the end of your life!  An old sign is seen at the western wall.

Long ago, MAOSHIN, a monk was rejected from the Council of Monks because
of his evil intentions and relentless behavior of hatred.  From his
punishment of being banished, he came upon these realms in hopes of creating
a new force of evil.  Maoshin, with his powers, created this huge dungeon of
sorts and travelled in many different lands in hopes of obtaining the most
perilous warriors/monsters in Phoenix.  With this huge establishment came
the creation of the 36 Chambers of Death!  Many have come to test their
skills but have paid their lives and never leaving here in peace.  Rumor was
told that anyone who was able to destroy all monsters of the 36 chambers
would soon be tested with the most ultimate monster..  But that awaits.
Live long...  And test...

The 36 Chambers of Death ..... Feel the Pain.

around and gasp as you realize the chamber you have entered upon is a golden
honeycomb smelling of nothing but honey!  Numbers of tiny little bees fly
around within honeycomb to honeycomb harvesting.  Puddles of honey are seen
around you with a small empty table to the western wall.  You gasp again as
you notice a recently deceased body filled with bee-stings all over being
slowly eaten alive by a swarm of bees!  An exit is out north but you wonder
how you'll be able to touch the door with all that honey..  The bees might
attack you!

Echoes of evil cackling and screams of horror are heard along the chamber

enigma arousing your curiousity into following yourself to the darkness
beyond.  The dirt soil beneath your feet covers the hard layered cement as
you drag yourself exhausted from your already past encounters.  Several
bones from a human skeleton lie scattered along side this tunnel with
cobwebs built upon it.  A passage to the north is visible.  To the south,

The faint smell of candles illuminates the room in a peaceful yet deathly
quiet manner.  Sounds of faint music are heard..  Sort of like a bamboo
flute.  Your eyes gaze at the spectacular banners that are hung along the
northern and southern wall of the chamber.  A logo of a huge dragon is on
the southern banner while to the northern banner is the logo of a snake.
Tiny walled candles fill along the room.  A small altar is seen before you

sorts.  Strangely this chamber is extraordinarily big.  Ropes are set all
around you preventing you to exit the room!  You look around somewhat
confused and in thought as to why this room looks so familiar to you.  A
small chair is set at the northwestern and southeastern corner of the
chamber!  You suddenly are dumbfounded by the fact that you have entered an
ancient boxing ring!  Ghosts of all sorts are seen around you high above the
ceiling shouting and cheering!  You are the fighter!  But who is your
opponent?  Your heart beats rapidly as you stand there indecisive of your
actions.  An exit is to the north.  A dangling rope hangs from the darkness

The entire room is camoflauged in a strange silvery black color.  Along
the walls around you, stand sacred weapons and armor of ancient samurai
times.  Blades of shiny steel and gold sparkle the room giving your eyes a
slight squint as you wander your eyes.  A strange garment of sorts in a

wall with 3 other pieces of armor, one a helmet, one a pair of shin
protectors, a pair of golden gloves and a pair of strange glowing bracers.
To the western wall are five of the finest blades from the samurais to be
held from thousands of years past.  Although these equipment would suit you
good for battle, you suddenly blink and see them instantly gone!  You look
around and notice instantly the room has emptied clean!  Chamber doors are

casting spells on hideous creatures visualizing horrifying pictures of blood

NOTE: It is advised that a party of 2 or more enter these realms due to the
possible extreme difficulty of the mobs and the damage they emit (including

The 35th Chamber of Mindgames~
Strange objects are floating about you as the room seems to be spinning.
You are somewhat dazed by the strange colors that fill the walls.  You hold
on to the door trying to regain your equilbrium but don't know what to do.

An evil voice says, 'You cannot leave here alive... You cannot leave here 
alive!!

north.

The 36th Chamber of the Final Resurrection~
Your eyes suddenly are blinded!  A scorching ray of light shoots at you
as you stagger not able to see what's around you!!  Your foot seems to have
tripped over something as you lose balance and almost fall here.

Down the Long Coiling Stairway~
With each step into the dark stairways down, you notice several bats
fly away from you off to the chambers above.  You pause for a moment and
debate whether to continue or abort this entire adventure..  You shake your
head and decide to make a decision...  You've come too far to wuss out.

A Dead End~
The room stops here as you have entered what seems to be a dead end.  To
your fright you notice horrifying drenches of blood shot about here and
there on the walls.  Several scraps of flesh are lying here and there as you
take caution to what dwells in here.

Enter the Monk's Chamber~
This is the final confrontation of the 36 Chambers.  You have entered the
37th Chamber.  Portraits of all 36 monsters are hung across the walls here.
A strange table seats at the corner of the room with a barred-up door that
heads north.  Splatters of blood are seen all around as you find yourself
trapped with no possible exits.

You arrive at a humongous building reaching high above you.  The castle
itself is humongous in structure and is massive in every way..  A SIGN is
posted here..  I think you should read it.
