0 DESERT~
{yThe Desert was originally built in a circular-shaped grid to allow other
areas to be connected along it's perimeter.  Within the center of the huge
desert is an Oasis, which is only reachable by a mobprog trigger.  There is
one special item hidden within the desert, which hopefully few will find and
even fewer will be able to solve it's puzzle.{x
