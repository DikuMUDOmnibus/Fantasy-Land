Dark Lords came - from these twisted shadows, that I am to name- They strode

death once again - It is this dark land, men fear as Hell - that breeds
great wolves, most dire and fell - The land of the dead, that the devil
stalks - the edge of the earth, where death itself walks - Believed by some,
to be a mythical land - but known by us, as home to the damned - Pay

{yAmragorne is the central area of the Land of Amragorne.  This dry dark
land is inhabited by many desert dwelling creatures, her human inhabitants
scarce.  The area is sealed once you enter the dark pass beneath the
mountains, passing the bloody wards.  {x
