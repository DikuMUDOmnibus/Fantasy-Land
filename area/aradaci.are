a soldier of the Red Sun~
A soldier of the Red Sun is here, ready for battle.
~
Before you stands a soldier that looks as if he was born for battle.  His
face could be made of stone as well as his body.  His head is shaved bald
except for a topknot hanging down the back of his head.  He seems to watch
everything at once and miss not a detail of any goings on.  He wears a
polished breastplate on his body with a red sun on the breast.  At his side
hangs a sword with a long handle.

Mrs. Heon is here, glaring at you.
~
Her silvery grey hair is tied tightly back in a bun on the top of her
head.  She scans around her kitchen constantly, looking for workers who are
not moving as quickly as they should.  She taps a large wooden spoon in her
hand as she rushes around the kitchen making sure everything is prepared on
time.

the mysterious stranger~
A stranger from another land is here, searching for something.
~
He stands in the shadows of the small room, a stranger to all.  An
battered looking leather hat sits on his head, it's wide brim making shadows
across his rough, unshaven face.  On his body he wears a leather jacket that
looks to have seen much adventure.  He looks at you with steel blue eyes,
the hard stare of a travelling man.  At his side hangs a coiled bullwhip and
you notice his hand begin to move closer to it.  He looks as if he could
have it in his hand anytime he wishes.  He does not look like one to be
tangled with.

neabaz nobleman~
Neabaz~
A tall handsome nobleman is unhappy you have bothered him.
~
This tall nobleman gazes and looks as you enter the room.  A frown forms
on his face as he looks to his wife and then back to you.  His hair is black
and falls almost to his shoulders, over his pointed ears.  He wears silk
pants and a silk shirt, both of the blackest silk.  Many jewels adorn his
body as he appears to be very wealthy, a traveller from another realm,
staying in the inn with his wife.  He gives her a small smirk as they both
look at you and for some reason you begin to feel a bit uncomfortable being
in their company.

Glasia noblewoman~
Glasia~
A beautiful noblewoman is here, tossing her hair as you enter.
~
You look upon this woman and marvel at her stunning beauty.  Her hair is
jet black and flows down her back to her waist in subtle curls.  Her eyes
are the color of translucent blue glass and her lips a rich crimson red. 
She wears the clothes of a rich noble, but not an ordinar one.  Her long
black dress is low cut and shows a slit up one leg, revealing her pale
smooth skin.  Her ears are pointed, showing her elven blood and just poke
out of her flowing hair.  She wears many rings and a golden necklace, off of
which hangs an odd looking pendant.  She looks at her husband with a mix of
love and dark desire then turns to you, obviously unhappy with your
interuption.

Tai'su~
An old man seems to blink in and out of existance...Tai'su.
~
His body does not look real at all.  One moment you gaze upon what looks
like an old man.  The next, part of his body turns to shadows and mist,
fading away and reappearing at random.  A strange light surrounds his head,
which never seems to fade away.  You see in his eyes the wrath of evil,
waiting to be released.

Roan Du'Saal~
The wandering druid Roan Du'Saal is here, selling his services.
~
You almost miss this man as you scan the room and find him sitting at the
end of the bar, sipping a glass of wine.  He wears forest green clothes and
a cloak around his body that seems to shift from brown to dark green and
back again so that it's true color remains a mystery.  A long thin wooden
staff rests by his side carved with many runes and symbols.  He is known as
a powerful druid and stories of his healing are told over many lands.  He
travels from city to city, selling his services to those in need.  It seems
he has stopped here, in the Red Dragon Inn, to sip some drink and stay a
spell.

Inside the East Gates of Aradaci~
Inside the gates of the city known as Aradaci people hustle in and out of
the huge iron gates that sit to your west.  They are carved with symbols and
designs that match the smoothly tiled road to the west.  Wagons pass you,
filled with people and goods, off to other cities to sell what they can. 
Guards stand aroud and at the gates like statues at attention.  They do not
seem to move but look as if they notice everything.  They wear polished
breastplate's with a red sun on the left breast.  They seem to take their
job very seriously and look as if they are very good at it.

Raiko's Victory~
You have heard the people on the streets talk of the huge road you now
walk along.  Raiko's Victory they call it, after the General of the cities
army.  Hoshiro Raiko lead the Army of the Red Sun to victory in the War of
Storms.  After that the King renamed the road after him and his victory. 
The smooth tiles hold ornate designs that look like the work of master
craftsmen.  People walk along the street, some hurrying, some simply
strolling.  The people look like they are from all places and it is hard to
tell the citizens from the outsiders.  It is obvious this place is a stop
for many travelers.  Raiko's Victory continues to the west while the gates
to the outside sit to the east.

You walk along the wide tiled road and notice the huge houses that line
the side of it.  Many stretch four stories high with huge windows covered in
stained glass.  A large flag hangs from each house declaring the sign of
their house or family.  These are obviously the houses of nobles, or at
least very wealthy people.  Servants scurry in and out of the houses
carrying bundles of linen or baskets of food for the people who live within.
Side streets lead north and south here and despite their dark appearance
many people seem to be traveling them.  Raiko's Victory takes you east and
west.

the street seem even smaller.  The street is made of cobblestones and you
can see the signs of wear in them as many are missing or cracked.  The small
street turns to the east here and the main street of Raiko's Victory is to

are judged in the Kings Court.  Small lanterns hang along the circular walls
that surround you.  Huge stairs spiral upwards to the top of the tower and a
small room lies to the north.  Another set of stairs leads downward and you
think you can hear the screams and cries of prisoners who are being
interrogated below.  The door to the outside stands to the east.

clouds.  You have heard its name spoken by the citizens of Aradaci, it is
the Tower of Judgement.  A place where the worst criminals of the city are
taken to live out the rest of their lives in solitude until their death. 
Some people say that the tower was not always a prision, that long ago, it
was something much more.  A ways to the south you can see a massive white
building.  To the east you see a small wooden door leading into another
small building.  The smooth unmarked tiles of the Kings Road take you north
and south.

scattered about.  Stairs lead up to the floor of the tower and to the west
you see that bars of a lone jail cell.  Also scattered about the room are
racks of weapons and chains to hold those who would attempt escape.

There is no light here and you can feel the damps of the close walls around
you.  You cannot stop the feeling of despair from settling on your shoulders
as you stand here.  Through the thick iron bars to the east is the guard
room.

red dragon painted along a mirror behind it.  The ceiling of the room is
high enough for two ogres and stairs at the back of the room lead to the
rooms above.  A tall skinny man sits behind the desk reading a book.  He
does not seem to take notice of you or any of the other people in the room. 
The Inn's register sits on the desk, filled with the names of travelers that
have passed through.  A set of stairs lead up to the rooms above and you can
see the tables of the dining room to the south.  On the wall behind the desk
hangs a large sign for newcomers of the Inn, or people wondering how they
might get a room.

You begin to wonder how high you have climbed and why anyone would put a
jail this high up.  It is said by the people of Aradaci that long ago this
tower was built as a monument to the King of the time.  It was built as a
private chamber for him.  His own place of peace.  Then the King was
poisoned by his own son in an attempt to capture the throne.  After being
judged he was put into the top of the tower until his death.

It is the only thing that seems to brighten the dark desolate walls around
you.  It seems to stare at you though ruby eyes and you find it hard to look
away.  To the east is an iron door with a small sliding window, painted on
the door in red is a large skull.  To the west is another door almost
identical to the other, except for the black dagger painted on it.

Enter Wrath...~
As you step into the room the smell of decay hits you.  The walls have
been covered with rotting bits of food, human waste and blood.  The lone bed
that sat in the corner has been smashed and the mattress torn in two.  It
dosent take you long to find the inhabitant of this room as a huge half-ogre
leaps to attack you.  His teeth are yellow and jagged and his breath reeks
of flesh.  His only clothes are tattered rags and his hair has been ripped
out by the roots.  Scars cover his face and body and as he opens his mouth
you see he has no tongue.  Shouldn't you have stayed outside?

but the people seem to enjoy them.  Servants come in and out of the kitchen
carrying large plates of food and drinks that smell delicious and you find
your mouth beginning to water.  You think you could stay and relax a bit and
have some food.  Perhaps even stay the night.

back wall and pots of stew sit bubbling on top.  Cooks and serving girls
quickly move from one place to the next, making sure everything is prepared
correctly.  A large woman in a clean white apron stands apart from the rest
of the workers.  Her white hair tightly tied behind her head.  She watches
them all very closely and taps a large wooden spoon into her palm.  By the
looks of her you do not think she could smile if her life depended on it.

The King Meets Raiko~
The intricate desgins of Raiko's Victory come to meld with the smooth,
unmarked tiles of the King's Road.  This spot is a landmark in the city of
Aradaci.  The joining of the King and his General-Advisor, a thing not to be
taken lightly by the people.  Many gather here, sitting on stone benches,
resting their legs from walking.  Raiko's Victory moves west while the
King's Road travels to the south.

You continue along the huge street with its crowds of people.  Huge
houses of nobles line the street on both sides and you find it hard to see
through all the people.  The road moves to the east and west.

On to Victory~
As you walk you begin to catch parts of the converstaions around you. 
The people speak mostly of war and of past victories.  Of the War f Storms
and of how Hoshiro slayed the leader of the Dra'pak, an orcish army if you
understood it right.  Of the King, Ulan Osaki, and his plans for Aradaci's
future.  By the words of the people he is a fair king, who was once a great
warrior himself.  You think you better move on, before anyone thinks your
staring.  A large intersection is to the west while the road continues east.

A Large Intersection ~
People seem to have gathered here in this large intersection.  They stop
and talk to one another, taking a break from their daily duties for a bit. 
Children run and play around the huge fountain that pours out crystal clear
water from its many spouts.  On top of the fountain stands a huge statue and
from the people talking and the road you travel you can only guess that it
is the likeness of Hoshiro Raiko that stares down at you.  Some soldiers of
the Red Sun pass by and stop to look up at the statue.  Some bow deeply and
then continues on.  You begin to wonder where this man Raiko is.  The road
goes on through the intersection and another road leads to the north and
south.

On the King's Road~
The road is wide, made from smooth tiles that hold no marks of any kind. 
As you walk along you think that at any moment you could slip and fall on
this shining, polished road.  To the south you can see a huge tower, rising
up into the clouds themselves, and on its spire, the flag of Aradaci.  The
King's Road comes to a bend to the north.

As you walk along the wide smooth road you see people passing slowly. 
Some are coming out of the huge building to the south while others move
towards it.  No shops or merchants can be found here and the only things
boardering the road are huge marble statues of the former Kings of Aradaci. 
The road moves north to a huge tower and south to the Kings Court.

lanterns hang above them.  A crimson carpet trimmed in gold leads through
the waiting room and under the door to the north.  Guards like you have
never seen walk in and out of the room.  They wear no armor, only long red
robes, and carry no weapons.  They are the Honor Guard of the King.

battles and soldiers.  At the north end of the room you see that the floor
raises a bit, and atop the large pedestal is a high back chair made from
gold.  The back of the chair is very high and you notice that it is in the
shape of a dragons head, complete with rubies for eyes.  The arms of the
chair are the dragons claws, as well as the legs.  Red carpet reaches in a
strip from the chair all the way to the door to the south.  To the west you
notice a smaller door that seems to blend in with the wall.

not paying much attention to their surroundings.  They talk as they stroll
and you can pick out some words but cannot make sense of them.  The road
extends to the north and south.  To the northwest you can see a large
building with small wisps of smoke coming from the brick chimney.

wide street are the carts and stands of merchants.  These are not only the
merchants from Aradaci.  Traveling merchants from all over come here and
petition the King so that they may sell there goods here.  People come to
Aradaci from many different places so the merchants know they can do much
business.  The road moves east and to the west you can see it bend to the
north.  To the south is a large shop with a sword painted on its open door. 
To the north you can see a very large building with many animals painted on
a sign outside.

on their way, not wanting to spend more time here than they have to.  Many
of the buyers are servants sent from their manors to buy things for the
Lords and Ladies.  To the south is a fairly large shop with a man in armor
painted on the door.

around here, turning away any who do not have business with the King inside.

Amongst the trees on the trail.~
You travel along a trail that is very wide.  As you look to the west you
think you can make out the high walls of a city in the distance.  You think
that by the size of this trail the cities army must use it very often.

The well travelled trail.~
To the west you can see the huge walls of a city.  Scattered trees line
the trail and thicken to the east.  The trail is wide and looks very well
used.

Outside the East Gates of Aradaci~
You stand before the huge iron gates leading into the city of Aradaci. 
The walls of the city are of white marble and very clean.  They seem plain
somehow except for the huge golden crane engraved in the middle of the
gates.  It is backed by a large red sun that takes up almost all of the
entrance.  You wonder what it could stand for...

Off the trail.~
The trees seem to close in around you as the forest thickens.  The smell
of pine and sap reaches your nose and you think you can hear breathing, very
close by.  You can see a small trail to the north.

Into the forest.~
As you walk through the forest you must constantly watch for small limbs
and sticks that scrape your skin.  The trees here are dense and grow even
more so to the north.  Some areas of the forest are so thick that they block
your way to the east and west.  To the south you can see a trail.

The dense forest.~
There is no trail on which to walk but the growth of the trees forces you
either north or south.  On the ground you can see dead branches and other
sorts of debris that has gathered here over the years, you do not think many
people travel this way.

Among the trees.~
Travel here is difficult and you are almost positive that you have become
lost in the forest.  You cannot remember which is the way back to the easier
terrain.  The trees are tall and almost block out all light with their huge
branches.

In the forest.~
As you press on through the forest, you begin to look at the trees that
surround you.  The trunks are massive and you do not think two ogres holding
hands could circle their big arms around one.  The bark is very dark and
hard, giving off a faint scent that is pleasant to your senses.  The trees
around you rise into the sky and their peaks are hard to make out.  You
think that you should move on, before you become even more lost.

Within the dark wood.~
The forest here is extremely quiet, the sounds of your boots on the
scattered twigs rings out with an echo that makes you think you are being
followed.  You scan around you constantly, as you feel strange eyes watching
you from all sides.  You do not know which way to go, but the silence around
you tells you that the wood must be deserted.  Although the feeling of being
watched closely tells you different...

Lost in the trees.~
The trees seem to push you in all directions and you must walk carefully,
looking for new places to squeeze through the huge trees.  You wonder how
the trees can grow in this fashion, in a way so that you must travel in a
certain direction.  You suppose it they could have just grown naturaly this
way but for some reason you think there is another explanation for it all.

Deeper into the forest.~
The path you walk along is not really a path at all.  The ground is
strewn with branches and the trees grow randomly.  But there is a definate
direction that you must travel.  As if the trees grew here to make a hidden
trail, or one like no other that you have ever seen.

Storage Room~
This small room doubles as a store room for the temple and a gathering
place of the equipment for the needy.  A large chest filled with equipment
rests against the walls.  The comforting halls of the temple are to the
north.

The Temple of the Red Sun~
The grand Temple of the Red Sun rises up above many of the buildingsin
Aradaci.  Dedicated to the grand ideals of the warrior, and most notably
Mattheus God of the Red dragon, this temple is used to help provide rest and
comfort to those who hold those ideals.  An adjoining room to the south
seems to be a storage room of some variety.  The sun rising to the east
causes red light from the stain glassed windows to light up the ailse
leading back to the city.
