Leur's Jewelery Shop~
Magnificently made peices of jewelery line the walls.  Each peice hand
made by Xyaadd herself, with countless hours of time.  Each peice looks
exactly the same and is seemingly perfect.  There are many anklets and wrist
bands lining the shelves.  Behind the counter is a elegant half-elven woman
crafting something new.
