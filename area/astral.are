gate~
You see a huge, glowing gate wrought from an incredibly hard translucent

A plaque is inset into the wall next to one side of the gate.

The plaque reads: 

Let this gate stand to protect mortal man for all time against the perils of 
the outer planes of existence and the creatures fair and foul that dwell within.

The Forge~
In the center of the room is a massive furnace which emits great gouts of
heat and a strange smell which comes from the melting of the silvery metal used
by the githyanki.  A large trough of icy water stands to the west, used for 
quenching hot metal.
   Doorways stand to the north and south.  The furnace door lies to the east.

The Githyanki Armoury~
A large chamber, full of suits of armor in various states of completion.  In
this chamber the hard steels of the githyanki are shaped into ornately fashioned
suits of mail.

doorway to the south.  An iron door stands to the west.

Inside the furnace~
You gasp for breath and choke on toxic sulphur and brimstone.  The sweat
on your forehead is instantly vaporized by the flames that surround you.  You
begin to feel faint and dizzy from the heat...

... you'd better leave before you pass out and burn to a cinder!

A guard station~
You are standing in a small, fairly empty building that serves as the prison
for the keep.  The building is small because the githyanki do not make a habit 
of taking prisoners, and those that they do capture do not last long.
   The cellblock lies to the west and the grey stone road is to the east.
