Dearest Sister,
Please let us put aside all our differences, and strive to reconcile this rift that
has come between us.  I am willing to forgive you your treasonous behaviour
with Accolon, but I must demand that you remove your son from my halls
and bid him accept that he can never be king of these lands.  I also must
insist that you return back to me Excalibur, which is my sword, by divine
right.
Arthur, Pendragon of Britain.

Lake~
This lake borders Camelot.  The mist makes it difficult to see ahead and
the ground is very uneven underfoot.  There are faint lights shining in the
mist from the south and the east.  The way back to Camelot has suddenly
disappeared.

Lake Shrine~
This is a lake shrine to some small, unnamed deity.  There is a small
standing stone with a rude altar in front of it.  The altar is scattered
with various offerings; bread and flowers are strewn about the stones and
altar.  The cold mist from the lake drifts over you, chilling you to the
bone.

of the sacred circle.  A small altar sits in the center of the stones,

The path ends at the large oak tree.  There is a loud moaning coming from
the tree....  Perhaps the only sound on the island.  In a large cleft of the
oak tree is a human figure writhing in agony.  He reaches out to you
pleading, "Mercy, have mercy on me."  This man is Kevin, the false Merlin of
Britain, who was accused and found guilty of high treason to the High
Priestess of Avalon, and to the Holy Order of Druids.

Chants emanate from within the lake house, and the rustle of people rushing
by can be heard periodically.  The Gatekeeper's room lies to the north, and
a plain door is to the south.  The Gatehouse lies back to the east and to

This is perhaps the only finely decorated room in all of Avalon...  Of
course it belongs to Morgause, cousin of King Arthur.  Morgause seems to
care more about her looks and possessions than from learning from the high
priestesses of Avalon.  It is said she is only here to learn how to defeat
Arthur, but her vanity holds her back from learning and improving.

This is a room of sorrow.  It is draped in black, and only one sparse

Merlin of Britain with his attempted betrayal.  Kevin's harp rests on a
table besides her bed, and his staff leans against the wall.  Nimue's sorrow
for the loss of Kevin has consumed her, and she will live the rest of her
life missing him in her self created prison in Avalon.
