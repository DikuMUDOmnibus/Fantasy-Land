Like islands in a sea of sand, Oasis's serve as the only source of life
sustaining water in the vastness that is the desert.  Lush palms, some

washes from over the water bringing welcome relief from the desert heat.

beneath you as it propells you ever faster towards a small gully betwwen

antlion emerges from the sand to grasp you in its vise like mandables.

swells in every direction.  The temperature in this area alternates between
extreme heat during the day and bitter cold during the evening.  It is a
wonder that anything at all can survive, let alone thrive in this dry,
desolate wasteland.  In every direction lie the interminable swells of
dunes.

Like islands in a sea of sand, Oasis's serve as the only source of life
sustaining water in the vastness that is the desert.  Lush palms, some
bearing fruit, huddle close to the small bubbling pool.  A cool breeze
washes from over the water bringing welcome relief from the desert heat. 
Recent signs of a visitation from nomads is evident though they have long
since left.

palms and other vegetation has been hacked apart and an oily film covers the
water.

The vastness of the desert is staggering as dunes rise and fall in great
swells in every direction.  The temperature in this area alternates between
extreme heat during the day and bitter cold during the evening.  It is a
wonder that anything at all can survive, let alone thrive in this dry,
desolate wasteland.  In every direction lie the interminable swells of
dunes.

{3--==[{0 The Obsidian Shield{3 ]==--{0~
Large black pillars rise up out of the hot desert sands.  In between the
pillars the air shimmers and wavers making it impossible to see what lies
beyond.  The invisible barrier does more than block site as it is impossible
to move any further in that direction.  The obsidian shield seems to extend
to the west, while to the east a large, well guarded arch looms out of the
desert.

{3--==[{0 Before The Black Gate{3 ]==--{0~
Rising up out of the desert like a mountain of onyx lies the great black
gate of Khaldune.  It was said long ago that the people of Khaldune, largest
of all the oasis's in Badu al-Kabir, were nearly destroyed and their oasis
died up by the evil magic of a dragonne.  After fending the beast off the
magicians of the oasis gathered together and created the obsidian shield. 
This shield would keep any who were unwanted out of the city.  As a side
affect it created a field of anti-magic within the city.  While this was
fine with the residents it did not suit the mages well.  The mages left and
the city has since been very anti-magic user.  The rule in fact is that any
who are found using magic within its gates is subject to becoming a water
slave to the sultan for all eternity.  Here is where the obsidian shield
comes together to form a giant arch leading into the city.  The light seems
to glisten through the archway to the north while in all the other
directions the desert swells like the sea.

Desert Sands~
The vastness of the desert is staggering as dunes rise and fall in great
swells in every direction.  The temperature in this area alternates between
extreme heat during the day and bitter cold during the evening.  It is a
wonder that anything at all can survive, let alone thrive in this dry,
desolate wasteland.  In every direction lie the interminable swells of
dunes.

Swirling Sands~
The sands shift in whirling shapes all around, from horizon to hotizon. 
There is no change from the monotony of dunes whipped up by the harsh wind. 
To the west the sands are being whipped into an even greater frenzy, if that
is possible.  In fact, it looks that a sandstorm is arising.

Sandstorm~
The swirling sands come to gether here in a whipping frenzy of sand.  The
sun is nowhere in sight as the flying grains tear at flesh and hinder sight.
A whirling cyclone approaches with nowhere to flee.  The only chance to
escape is to enter the eye of the sandstorm and hope to gather your
bearings.

Large black pillars rise up out of the hot desert sands.  In between the

Desert Sands~
The vastness of the desert is staggering as dunes rise and fall in great
swells in every direction.  The temperature in this area alternates between
extreme heat during the day and bitter cold during the evening.  It is a
wonder that anything at all can survive, let alone thrive in this dry,
desolate wasteland.  In every direction lie the interminable swells of
dunes.

Maki dar-Salar~
Like islands in a sea of sand, Oasis's serve as the only source of life
sustaining water in the vastness that is the desert.  Lush palms, some
bearing fruit, huddle close to the small bubbling pool.  A cool breeze
washes from over the water bringing welcome relief from the desert heat.

Large black pillars rise up out of the hot desert sands.  In between the

The desert crashes hard against the slopes of the steep mountains rising
to the north , effectivly blocking off all passage in that direction.  As
the sand ricchochets hard off the bare rock, born into the air by swirling
winds, it slices into your body causing scratches to form unbidden.  It
would be wise to move back to the flatter grounds to the west, while the
mountain border continues to the east and west.

Mountain Barrier~
The desert crashes hard against the slopes of the steep mountains rising
to the north , effectivly blocking off all passage in that direction.  As
the sand ricchochets hard off the bare rock, born into the air by swirling
winds, it slices into your body causing scratches to form unbidden.  It
would be wise to move back to the flatter grounds to the west, while the
mountain border continues to the east and west.

Smoke from a dozen fires drift low in the still desert air, and the rich
smells of cooking, livestock and people mingle like a marketplace.  The
Khaldunis are an energetic people, obviously wealthy and well-dressed.  They
are also a people obviously at war, for almost every adult you see wears
weapons, even if only a jamiyah.  Toward the southwest of the oasis there
are a large number of tents and huts, where apparently most of the Khaldunis
live.  To the north are palm plantations and the main camel pen is to the
west.  At the center of the oasis is the tiny marketplace s''s opulent
spring.  Despite the cheerful and prosperous cast to the town, wvwerywhere
you look there are black-clad warriors watching your every move.
