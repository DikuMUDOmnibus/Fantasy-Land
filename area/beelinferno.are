When courting your sheep, never forget that salt blocks are invaluable in
the art of seduction.  Always carry one with you.  Clover can also help sway
the most difficult of sheep.

Choosing a sheep as a mate is a tedious process.  I recommend staying away from slaughterhouses as most sheep from these places are so traumatized they never accept true love.  
I highly recommend sheep farms for proper mate selection.

The Dark Wood~
There are trees everywhere.  It is very dense and there doesn't appear to
be much of a path ahead.  There are no signs of wildlife in the area and the
forest is completely silent.

The Gate of the Inferno~
There is an inscription carved into the stone above this massive gate. 
There are a vast multitude of of spirits running behind a flag in great
haste and confusion, urged on by furious wasps and hornets.  These are the
unhappy people, who never were alive -- never awakened to take any part in
either good or evil, to care for anything but themselves.  They are mixed
with a similar class of fallen angels.

An inscription carved into the stone above the gate reads:
"Through me is the way into the doleful city; through me the way into the eternal pain;
through me the way among the people lost. Justice moved my High maker; Divine Power made
me, Wisdom Supreme, and Primal Love. Before me were no things created, but eternal; and
eternal I endure: leave all hope, ye that enter."

The Chamber of Judgement~
Here Minos sits horrific, and grins: examines the crimes upon the
entrance; judges, and sends according as he girds himself.  When the
ill-born spirit comes before him, it confesses all; and that sin-discerner
sees what place in hell is for it, and with his tail makes as many circles
round himself as the degrees he will have it to descend.  Always before him
stands a crowd of them; they go each in its turn to judgement; they tell,
and hear; and then are whirled down.

Acheron; and on its Shore all that die under the wrath of God assemble from
every country to be ferried over by the demon Charon.  He makes them enter
his boat by glaring on them with his burning eyes.

The Entrance to the Third Circle~
The Third Circle, that of the eternal, accursed, cold, and heavy rain;
its law and quality is never new.  Large hail, and turbid water, and snow,
pour down through the darksome air; the ground, on which it falls, emits a
putrid smell.  Cerberus, a monster fierce and strange, with three throats,
barks dog-like over those that are immersed in it.  His eyes are red, his
beard greasy and black, his belly wide, and clawed his hands; he clutches
the spirits, flays, and piecemeal rends them.  The rain makes them howl like
dogs; with one side they screen the other; they often turn themselves, the
impious wretches.

The Entrance to the Fourth Circle~
Here at the entrance to the Fourth Circle is Plutus, the ancient god of
riches, mumbling some strange words.  In this circle -- divided into two
halves -- there are two separate classes of spirits, that are coming in
opposite directions, rolling large dead Weights; smiting these against one
another; and then, with bitter mutual reproaches, each turning round his
Weight, and rolling it backwards, till all meet and smite again, "at the
other joust," or other end of the two Half-circles.  It is the souls of the
Prodigal and Avaricious that have this punishment.

dead Weights; smiting these against one another; and then, with bitter
mutual reproaches, each turning round his Weight, and rolling it backwards,
till all meet and smite again, "at the other joust," or other end of the two
Half-circles.  It is the souls of the Prodigal and Avaricious that have this
punishment.

The River Styx~
Upon the brink of the next circle, there is a stream of dark water,
gushing down a cleft, which it has worn out for itself; and this water forms
a marsh called Styx; which occupies the Fifth Circle.  In this Marsh are
spirits, all muddy and naked, assailing and tearing each other.  These are
the souls of the Wrathful.  Beneath them, and covered with black mud, are
the souls of the Gloomy-sluggish, gurgling in their throats a dismal chant. 
Through the grim vapour one can discern the pinnacles, red, as if they had
come out of fire, of the City of Dis.

Erinyes, are the avenging goddesses who haunted and tormented those who had
committed great great crimes, particularly murder in the family.  Few have

Malebolge~
The circle itself occupies the whole of a shelving space, which lies
between the foot of the high wall and the brim of another (lower) shaft or
"well" that is exactly in the centre; and it is divided (in successive
rings) into ten deep fosses or chasms, resembling the trenches which begird
a fortress, and each containing a different class of sinners.  Across these
chasms, and the banks which separate them from one another, run cliffs from
the outer border of the circle down to the central well, forming lines of
roads and bridges that also resemble those by which a fortress is entered
from different sides.  The well contains the Traitors and Satan, "Emperor of
the dolorous kingdom," in the middle of them.

Immediately the sinner bursts into flames, burns, and crumbles to ash.  Just
as rapidly, the form grows again out of the ashes, stunned and bewildered
with the pain.

again.  Each suffers according to the severity of the sin.

The Center of Dis~
This is Judecca, home of the Traitors against God and Leader.  There is a
huge, shadowy form that can only be Satan.  Satan is frozen to his chest in
the ice but his three sets of wings are free to beat.  Ironically, Satan
beats these wings in a furious eternal attempt to escape, but it is these
wings that keep him frozen in the one place in the universe farthest from
God.  Satan has three faces -- red, yellow and black -- and each chews on a
sinner.  The sinner in the middle, head first in Satan's mouth, is
continually stripped of his flesh by Satan's clawing hands.  This is Judas,
the apostle who betrayed Christ and set in motion the crucifixion.  In the
other two are Julias Caesar's assassins, Brutus and Cassius.  A small
stream, the Lethe, leads north.

The Reception Area~
A large wooden desk sits near the doorway.  The top of the desk is
littered with papers and file folders.  Several file cabinets sit in one
corner.  Each is crammed full of folders.  An uncomfortable wooden bench
sits against one wall.  Here is where processing begins.

Rickety Metal Stairs~
A narrow metal staircase leads down into darkness.  With each step you

Final Processing Area~
A large round chamber made entirely of gleaming grey marble stands before
you.  Three hallways lead to the north, east, and west.  Each is a different
color.  A strange vibration fills the air.  Confusion fills you as you think
of which hallway to enter first.  A burly demon yanks the metal ticket from
your hand, grins, and shoves you harshly down a hallway.

A swirling vortex filled with lost souls sits in the center of this
chamber.  It seems bottomless, reaching forever downward into nothingness. 
Souls who could be neither satanic or angelic come here.  Those souls who
linger undecided are cast here as well.  The vortex seems to pull you
forward, threatening to topple you into the midst of the lost souls.
