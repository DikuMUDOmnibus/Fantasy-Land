Gyrod~
Apparantly this guest has made this his permanent room.
~
You look at Gyrod, and ponder how he might have gotten his own room here.
He is a bit of a slob as elves go, but you can tell by the way he looks you
over that he is not one to be trifled with.  Gyrod grins at you and asks,
"Can I help you?"  .

Main Entrance~
You stand at the entrance to the magnificent floating castle.  A
beautiful Elven woman stands here, smiling at you.  She says, "Welcome to
Castle Soleil, we are honored to have you as our guest".  You feel a strange
sense of contentment as she speaks, and you really do feel welcome here. 
You look down at the ground below and a chill runs up your spine.  You
wonder just how stable this castle is.

A Hallway~
As you enter the castle, the gates close with a loud crash.  Looking
around you see what looks like a normal castle.  Tapestries line the walls,
depicting great battles from a past age, and tremendous magical acts. 
Torches are spaced at regular intervals along the walls, providing some
semblance of light.

the hallway continues.

room, taking in every minute detail.  Right in the center of the room you
see a huge oaken table, with ten chairs around it.  There is a fireplace at
the end of the hallway, and several comfortable looking couches are set in
front of the fire.

whose identity you can only guess.  Along the southern wall, there are
paintings of great battles and feats of magic.  In the center of the room,
there is a large oaken table, presumably to seat the diners.  Against the
far southern wall, a giant marble fireplace holds a roaring fire under
control.  All around the room, people are milling about, talking to this
person or that.

Great Hall~
The most notable feature of this room is the portaits hanging along the
wall in front of you.  You stand before one, a painting of a wise-looking
man.  His hair is long and white, and his face is nearly distorted by
wrinkles, but there seems to be a twinkle of incredible intelligence coming
from his eyes.  The plaque under the picture reads, "Aaniron, Royal Magician
during the reign of Selartus."

white flowing robes, standing on top of a mountain.  He holds a blazing red
staff high over his head.  It is then that you notice the dragon, flying
over his head.  You can only wonder how that battle turned out.

Hanging along the south wall is a painting of a terrible scene.  It is a
tableau of a battle, apparantly with an entire army facing one person.  As
you look closer at the person in the center of the painting, the one cutting
down dozens of soldiers with a single wave of His arm, you notice that it is
a giant demon, bathed in magical fire.  You feel sorry for the poor soldiers
thrown in front of His path.

It's cold in here!  You wish you had your trusty hat and mittens right about
now.  Looking around at all the food in here, you notice that one of the
shelves is completely empty.  Other than that, there is a lot of food in
here, but none of it is appetizing to you.

leading to another guest room.  To the south you see a strange-looking door.

This room is used by Bel'Gwaran to house his guests.  There are not many
creature comforts in here, aside from the bed and the small dresser in the
corner, this room is bare.  A thin layer of dust covers the floor.

fact that the castle your are in is actually floating hundreds of feet in
the air.  You suddenly feel rather queasy, but your adventurer training

You stand in the hallway, and look around you.  To your north, an open
door leads into what appears to be someone's living quarters.  No one is in
the room at the time, but it looks as if it has been lived in recently.  To
the east, there is a door to the north and a door to the south.  To the
west, the hallway branches to the north and south.

Lady Teldra's room~
You stand in Lady Teldra's bedroom and allow your eyes to adjust to the
bright sunlight flooding in from a giant window along the eastern wall. 
When your eyes fully adjust, you can see that the Lady is quite fond of
sunflowers.  Massive sunflower plants decorate the entire room, and you can
barely even see the Lady's bed through the flora.  The Lady keeps her room
very tidy other than the occasional small pile of dirt, and you do not want
to step any farther into the room for fear of tracking mud on her carpet and
inflicting the true wrath of the Lady Teldra.
