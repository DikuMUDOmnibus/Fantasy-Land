A hideously deformed creature ambles towards you.
~
The creature you see before you might have been human at one point in
time, but it so horribly disfigured and scarred, that you cannot deign to
call this creature a natural phenomenon.  Someone with a very sick mind was
messing with this creature, and something was done to it, something that
turned the poor thing away from humanity forever.

This gigantic white dragon is pathetically shackled to the far wall of

effective.  You can walk up to the dragon and attack it, but then you will
be in range of its claws and its breath.

walls here are carved directly out of what would appear to be the
foundations of the castle.  The work is so precise that it could only have

its tongue has been removed.

A Hallway~
The hallway splits into a T section here.  To the west, the hallway
continues a little bit, and ends with a large wooden door.  To the south the
hallway continues, then turns west.  Some curiously deformed creatures
wander about the basement freely, making low gutteral noises to themselves.

hear voices coming from the other side of the door, but you cannot make out
any words.

A Hallway~
The hallway here goes north and south.  The hallway to the north splits
off to the west twice.  The hallway to your south goes off to the east a
little ways down.  You again catch the whiff of a very foul odor.  You hear
voices coming from the west , from behind the wall.

A Big Room~
As you open the door and step into the room, you see two people playing
cards at a small table in one corner of the room.  They seem too engulfed in
their game to even pay you any attention as of yet.  In the other corner of
the room, there are two cots, and two small footlockers at the feet of the
cots.

A Big Room~
The Captain of the Guard is here, playing some sort of card game with
his men, who are obviously trying to lose.  As you step closer to the table,
the captain looks up at you and says, "Hey!  What are you doing in here?!?"

A Big Room~
In the corner of this room, you can see the cots that the men sleep on,
and their footlockers, which are located at the foot of the cots.  This
doesn't look like a very comfortable place to sleep.

In this corner of the room, you can see the table where the guardsmen are
playing cards, and you can see the cots where they sleep.  There are no
other amenities of life in the room.

A Dark Hallway~
The hallway runs north and east here.  To the east the hallway goes to
the south, and to the north the hallway splits off to the west, quite aways
down.  The walls are covered in a slimy film, probably due to the incredible
amount of moisture in the air.  It is definitely begging to smell worse as
you walk down the hallway, and it is now also getting hotter with each
progressive step.  You wipe the sweat from off of your brows and continue on
forward.

A Damp Hallway~
The hallway continues east and west, and the smell is getting worse. 
There is enough moisture in the air, that some of it is collecting on the
walls, and you can tell that it is not pure water that is wafting through
the air.  You run your finger along the wall, and a brownish film is left on
your fingertip.  You wipe your finger on your shirt, shudder slightly,
debate on which direction to go next.

The hallway starts to incline downwards here.  You can smell a putrid
stench coming from up ahead to the east.  There is a small puddle of
dark-colored water at your feet.

Ankle Deep in the Water~
The water level here rises up to your ankles.  The hallway turns to the
south, where you can see what appears to be the sewage system of the castle.
The sewage water would reach up to your waist if you decided to proceed to
the south.  The smell here is so foul, you can hardly breathe.

Waist Deep in Sewage~
The water here comes up to your waist.  The smell is awful, and you have
to squint your eyes to stop them from tearing up.  The sewage hallway
continues to the west.  You can hear a strange rumbling sound coming from
the west.

Sewage Containment Room~
You decide to take the plunge, and step into the waist-deep sewage water.
The smell here is so foul, you can hardly keep down your dinner.  Your eyes
begin to water profusely, and you begin to have second thoughts about being
here.  You feel something brush against your leg.  You stab your weapon in
the general area where you saw the motion, but you don't hit anything. 
Suddenly, you don't feel like being here for much longer.

Sewage Containment Room~
You are waist deep in sewage-water, and you can feel it begin to seep in
through your armor.  Hopefully, it won't stain your clothes, but your are
going to smeel of human waste for quite some time, of that you are certain. 
Splashing sounds to the south draw your attention.

Sewage Containment Room~
As you wade to this corner of the room, you can clearly see a snake like
organism wrapping around your legs, attempting to drag you under the sewage!
You steel your courage and attack the sewage snake with the frenzy of a true
adventurer.  Of course, being waist deep in sewage doesn't help your combat
abilities...

Sewage Containment Room~
You wade into the southeast corner of the room, and again you feel
something brush against your leg.  To the west, you see a long snake-like
organism surface for a minute, then it dives back down into the sewage.  You
are really begininng to wonder why you decided to do this.

A Dark Hallway~
The hallway turns north and east here.  To the east, the hallway is lit
by several torches, and you can see a door to the north at the end of the
hallway.  To the north, the darkness envelops your sight.  Carved onto the
south wall of the corner are the words " 'WaRE ThE DrAGon!"

A Lit Hallway~
The hallway here is lit by several torches affixed to the walls.  The
torches sputter out enough light that you can see a door further down the
hallway to the north.  The floor here is no longer dirt, but appears to be a
concrete material of some kind.  You can hear a muted growling noise coming
from beyond the wall to the north.  Strange stomping noises accompany the
growling.  More importantly, however, is the massive minotaur that guards
the door to your east.

A Lit Hallway~
This room is occupied by a huge minotaur, who snorts and strides towards
you.  He cracks his whip menacingly and eyes you down.  To the north, behind
the minotaur, you can see a heavy iron-bound door.  The keys appear to be
held by the minotaur.

A Short Hallway~
This short hallway goes east one more room, and there is a door to the
north at the end of the hallway.  You can hear the growling noise that you
heard before much clearer now.  There appears to be some kind of creature
behind the door down the hallway.  There are large scratch marks on the
sides of the walls and on the floors here, perhaps made by massive clawed
hands...

A Short Hallway~
You stand before the door, and contemplate your options.  You can turn
back around, and not see what's behind the door, or you can open the door,
and face whatever is making that horrible noise.  More of the claw marks can
be seen on the door and on the walls all around you.  The torches on the
walls flicker, casting wild shadows about the room.

The White Dragon's Room~
As soon as you open the door, you can see the source of the horrible
noise that you've been hearing.  A gigantic white dragon is in this room,
chained to a wall about thirty feet away from you.  Its chains prevent it
from attacking you, as it is trying to do quite strenuously, and it is too
far away for its breath weapon to be effective against you.  If you walk up
to it and attack it however, you run the risk of breaking the chains that
bind the dragon, allowing it to retaliate full force.
