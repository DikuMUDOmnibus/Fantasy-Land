smallish eyes.  She is locked in this cell for displeasing the King.  Once a

Georgina~
An assassin that failed sits here, trying to kill herself with her own chains.
~
Georgina is perhaps one of the most inept assassins ever born. 
Attempting to poison the King, she instead mistakenly poisoned the Royal
cat.  In an attempt to save its life by walking it around until the poison
wore off, she walked it to death, dragging it along by its leash for ten
miles in a circle until it choked to death.  If anything, she deserves to be
here for pure stupidity.

made of glows translucently in the bright sunlight.  The whole of the palace

blindingly with light, sending faceted rays of color streaming about you. 
The silver doors leading out of the palace are south, the way further inside

audience.  A lush blue carpet covers the floor and comfortable,
silk-cushioned benches are placed against the walls.  A large cherrywood
table is placed in the center of the room, loaded with drinks and foods,
delicacies from around the world.  A small bronze brazier is placed in the
middle of the table, burning an exotic fragrant incense you have never
smelled before.

entrance to the Royal Court.  Around you are rare tapestries and paintings,
showcased in frames of gold.  The very aura of resplendence that fills this
room overwhelms you.  You cannot wait to see the inside of the Royal Court,
if you can gain audience with the king.

Inside the Royal Court~
You have entered the southern Royal Court.  Swarms of courtiers crowd the
room, crying out for an audience.  The smell of perfume mixed with body odor
is overpowering and you fight just to stay conscious.  The thick red
carpeting here is trampled and thrashed from the weight of the thousands of
people that have walked and stood here through the years.  Fighting your way
through the angry throng, you see the doors leading out of here to the south
and the throne room to the north.

The Throne~
You have managed to reach the Throne and gain an audience.  The two
thrones that face you are massive platinum and glod chairs, encrusted with
rare and valuable jewels.  A shining sceptre is placed in between the two
thrones, glittering with a cornucopia of light from the jewels set into the
pommel.  Heavy banners and tapestries line the translucent walls and
overhead a large stained-glass skylight has been set into the amber ceiling,
depicting the Royal Crest of the Amber Palace Royalty.  Large gold braziers
filled with rare incense are burning in the corners of the room and a white
marble fountain is spouting water in the center.  A trio of white snow
leopards are chained and leashed to the fountains, snarling hungrily at you.

This throne is large.  It could easily seat two giants side by side and

You have reached the feasting hall of Amber Palace.  This room is
immense, with giant silver candelabrums lighting the room with a vast array
of tall white candles, the light bouncing off the amber walls to showcase
the room in a dazzling light.  Various marble statues sit in the corners of
the rooms and a grandiose wooden table is in the middle of the room,
stretching out to seat at least fifty people.  The shine of the silverware
and glasses set upon the table is almost blinding in the already bright
glare of the room.  You hear the clattering of cooking utensils to the
north.

bustling of busy chefs, preparing a meal for the Royal Family.  There is a

as stunning as the feasting hall, this room is not exactly shabby.  The
decor here is plain and simple, everything seeming to have a purpose of
usefullness rather than that of ornamentation.  The large wooden table seats
about forty people, but is made of a sturdy unfinished wood.  The lighting
of the room comes from a few open windows and a singe large copper brazier
in the middle of the table.  Simple stone plates and wooden mugs are set up
on the table, a bucket of water and some rags in the corner, ready to clean
up any messes made.

The Dungeon Cell~
You are in a dark cell in the dungeon.  The floor is covered with hay and
the only furnishings here seem to be a bowl full of sourish water and a
small uncomfortable cot.  The walls here are not made from amber, but a
slimy stone substance that is impossible to scratch or break.  There is no
lighting here, and as something grabs for your legs, you wonder if perhaps
you should leave this dismal cell.

light seems to come from a single torch inset into the north wall.  This

wonder what may be ahead of you.  You have heard many tales of grisly traps
and psychotic guards hidden here, and shudder as you hear the sound of a
sword being drawn in the darkness.

The Magician's Chambers~
You have discovered the chambers of the court's magician.  This chamber
is a total and utter mess.  Various beakers and vials lay strewn about the
floor and tables, spilling multi-colored fluids everywhere.  Star charts and
land mass maps are pinned to the walls, and pentagrams of every sort are
scrawled about.  Piles upon piles of books and large tomes are heaped
against the shelves, which look as if they are about to break under the
weight.  Jars of strange objects and dried animals are placed in the
northwest corner, and bags of herbs are heaped in the northeast corner.  It
is obvious that the palace maids never come up here.

The Bedchamber~
You are in the Court Magician's bedchamber.  Perhaps you should go back
outside to his main chamber.  At least it is neater outside.  The large bed
is completely covered with strange objects that you can not even begin to
fathom the uses for.  Scrolls and parchments litter the floor so thoroughly
that you cannot take a single step without crushing something.  Dusty
amulets and talismans are hanging from hooks set into the walls everywhere. 
A strange bluish flame burns in the middle of the room, coming from no
apparent source.

The Secret Alcove~
You have entered a secret alcove.  This is where the members of Royalty
would hide in times of crisis and emergency.  There is a cabinet here,
stocked with jugs of water and dried foods.  An empty chamber pot lies in
the corner, rags and torches stacked neatly underneath.  There is a door to
the north.

The Treasury~
You have found the Treasury!  You imagined heaps and heaps of gold here,
surrounded by piles of jewels and other priceless artifacts.  However, the
room is bare of anything except a plain lamp set up in the corner.  What a
disappointment.

floor.  A large ruby lantern shines a brilliant reddish light over the room,
revealing its treasures in a brilliant shower of colors.  You quickly grab a
backpack and begin to stuff it full.

You have found the secret chambers of the King's mistresses.  The room is
filled with plush silk pillows, large beds, tapestries of every sort, and a
larder stocked with food and wine.  Girls of every size, color, and race are
sprawled about, winking coquettishly as you draw near.  An exotic incense is
burning in the corner, next to an array of massage oils.

sits serenely in the middle of the gardens.  The frogs croak loudly, adding
their voices to that of the birds and the dragonflies buzz incessantly here.
The whole garden maintains an aura of peaceful harmony and you feel at ease

neatly against the wall to the north, and a set of red marking pencils are
in a jar atop the books.  A large slate board is against the south wall, a
container of colored chalks next to it.  It seems the King takes warring
very seriously.

the chambers themselves are two totally different tasks.  The corridors are
filled with darkness and you have no idea what traps or guards may lay in
wait for you.  Perhaps you should leave now.

You are inside a small room that acts as a storage cellar inside Amber

few odds and ends lying about.  A pile of small torches lie against the
southeast corner, and a small rat runs over your foot as you explore about.

The Trap Room~
You have fallen into one of the many trap rooms deep within Amber Palace.
The Royal Family, having anticipated robbers, assassins, and other
troublemakers, has installed these trap rooms as a mean to deal with scum
like you.  As you stand there, the room tilts, sending you sliding down a
strange chute.  You are dumped into a strange courtyard.
