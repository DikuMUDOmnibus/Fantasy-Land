Before the Entrance of the Beautiful Bangzui Gardens~
The air is perfumed with the sweet smell of jasmine and lotus
blossoms.  A large stone archway leads north into a serene garden.
This garden was made to create an atmosphere of tranquility and
contemplation.  There is a chinese calligraphic inscription on
the top of the stone archway.  It translates to, "Be welcome unto the
Garden of Ease".

be seen on it, representing the importance of balance in
serenity.  A stream gently flows underneath.  The bridge
is constructed so that one may take paths to the east, west

Garden of Blue Flowers~
Never before have so many shades of blue come together so perfectly. 
There is a strange unity in the varying shades, from the palest blue, so
pale it's almost white, to the darkest, coming close to blackness.  Some
flowers are easily recognizable by their look, some are hybrids of plants
never seen to people outside of this garden.  The room almost fluctuates in

A Cave~
The cave is peaceful and serene, matching the rest of the garden.
It seems to be a depository for sick banzai plants.  Plants are in
various stages of health here.

The Fruit Gardens~
Trees of all shapes and sizes adorn this garden.  Fruits as big as a
man's head are visible, as well as some that are so minute one must look
twice to actually see them.  Pomegranates weigh the thin branches down with
their weight, luscious persimmons do the same in their orange splendor. 
Oranges, lemons, citrus fruits of all kinds lend their scent to the others
in the gardens.  This is truly paradise.

The Garden Theatres~
Large pillars of ebony wood support the intricatley carved roof of the
theatres.  The stage is set for the performance later.  Silken material
lines the floors and the walls of the stage.  The only exit is back to the
east.

Garden of Zen~
A peaceful serenity abounds in this garden.  All the flowers seem almost
muted by the presence of some higher being.  Shade trees hang low almost
blocking out the sun, but it seems strangely right.  The only exit is to
your north.

The Black Garden~
{8This garden is somber, dark, yet somehow very relaxing.  Black roses,
tulips, and violets adorn the walking path that leads throughout it black
gravel stones crunch under each step taken...  Even the pond water is dark. 
Flicks of red and orange ripple under the surface, showing that life thrives
under even the darkest of situations.  {0

The Path to the Penultimate Garden~

huge floral covered trellis.
