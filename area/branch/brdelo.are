Spider~
A Large Spider~
A gangly spider is here, weaving a web.
~
A large, white spider with fangs that seem to be almost as large as the
hallway itself, dangles monotonously from the ceiling, hanging from a thin
piece of thread.  Its body is poised to attack anything that moves, it's
fang drip with a venomous poison that could instantly kill an object a
thousand times its weight.  Two rows of silvery eyes stare down at you,
waiting for your next move.

Carnivorous Rodent~
A Carnivorous Rodent~
A large rodent is here, gnawing on some remains.
~
A large furry animal that closely resembles a rat in looks, but not in
nature.  Dangerously agressive, it will hunt and devour anything that moves.
Its black fur is slick with the blood of former prey, and long gnarled claws
and all four feet still have bits of flesh on them.  It screeches a hideous
sound, as if shouting a warning to stay away if you don't want to die.

The Beast with Two Backs~
The beast with two backs is here, ignoring you.
~
It has two heads, one that looks remarkable female, the other male.  And
the two heads lead to two bodies that connect just below the torso, making
up this large beast.  It growls and moans, one head concentrating on the
other, it doesn't even notice your presence.  It moves with quick, smooth
motions, sometimes faster, sometimes slower.  A strange odor and heat
surrounds its body.

Corsica Stripper~
The stripper Corsica~
The beautiful Corsica dances provacatively for a worked up crowd.
~
She moves with the grace of an angel, but her motives are not quite so
holy.  Her body swaying suggestively to slow music, her hands taking the
money that is being offered for her hand.  She resembles an amazon, full in
figure and muscular at the same time.  Her beauty is alarming, her smiles
are deadly.

~
Full in figure, lithe, young, and vibrant, this cheerful and charismatic
woman works busily trying to keep the mansion in order.  She wears about
herself a tight french maid's uniform that barely covers her body, and some
black boots on her feet.  She smiles charmingly, greeting you with a silvery
laugh.

A Businessman~
A dirty businessman is here, looking for a lady to purchase.
~
An obese and sweaty man stands before you, panting heavily as he tries to
desperately find a young lady to spend the night with.  His dirty and
wrinkled clothes are indicators that he spends many a night here, and most
likely many a dollar as well.  His dark slicked back hair is wet with sweat
and grease, and he waddles persistently at every female that passes him by,
trying to sweet talk them into going to bed with him.

A hysterical, rowdy customer is here, screaming at the top of his lungs.
~
His hair is thick with gel and stands straight up in large, obnoxious
spikes.  He screams with a high pitched tone, shouting inaudible words as he
tries to convey whatever excitement he is feeling.  There is a strange odor
coming from him, sweet and hot like old cologne, but less appealing.

~
He is large in more ways than one, and the way he exposes them so
erotically is enough to make any woman melt.  Short locks of light hair soft
frame a long, handsome face, and rippled muscles cover his body, giving a
final touch such perfection.  He asks you if you would like to dance, and he
doesn't mean on stage.

Olive skin, dark eyes, soft brown hair, he is a woman's dream come true,
and his smile is even more reason to pursue him.  He flexes his muscles
teasingly, all the while slowly taking off his clothes for his hysterical
and love-sick fans.  He winks at you, asking you if you'd like to join in.

Marquelle~
The stripper, Marquelle, is here, entertaining her clients.
~
She is the exotic beauty of the bordello, with almond-shaped eyes, a
creamy complexion, and long dark hair that cascades down her soft white
shoulders.  Her movements are hypnotic, she beckons to you with a flick of
an eye and motion of her finger.  Her smile is charming, but there is a
dangerous side to it, a side that is undeniable even though she is
disarmingly gorgeous.

~
She is ignorant of your stares, her only thought is on the ball and how
she has to hit it to make it a good shot.  Her expressionless face is locked
only on the game, her mind deep in concentration.  Her rose colored hair is
tied up into a high pony tail that swishes slightly when she moves, and her
violet eyes are piercingly cold.  She is a prowess, dangerous and unabiding
to the rules and regulations of the game.

He walks crookedly into walls, and stumbles repeatedly onto the floor.  He
shakes his head to and fro, still laughing at nothing.

who dabbles in the pleasures of the flesh as often as she dabbles in the
words of religion.  Tonight she has cast aside her preaching gowns and
donned in its place a sheer, silky nightgown.  She smells of plumeria
flowers and vanilla, her favorite scents, and has her hair done up in a
simple bun.  On her fingers are golden rings, and she wears upon her ears
two tiny diamond earrings.

love affair, a tactic that was beyond lucritive as it was scandalous.  Her
hair is a deep blue color, which offsets her jade green eyes surprisingly
well.  She gazes upon her lover with adoring eyes, and at you with a cold,
cruel look.

Overly tweezed eyebrows, thick, pencilled lips, makeup that is a mix of

look female.  It shakes out it's long brown hair, and points a finger at
you, it's long acrylic nails shining maliciously in the light.

women may purchase for the night.  His suntanned skin and dark black hair

A Widing Path.~
A small path of worn cobblestone stretches itself before you, leading you
to a corner where darkness reigns, and light ceases to exist.  Low overhead
clouds loom in the sky, and sharp flashes of lighting and the roar of
thunder clash in the skies, creating a strangely demure scene to what
appears to have once been a great landscape.  There are gnarled trees on
both right and left sides, and dead foliage litter the ground.

The Blackened Gates~
A great set of large iron gates are erected at the top of the path.  Aged
from the abuses of weather and neglect, the gates themselves have lost their
shine and former glamor, and in its place is a thick coat of hard black
rust, which covers the great gates like a deadly parasite.  Dead plants and
weeds cling to the gates' hinges, trying to brave the harsh weather, and all
around there is an eniment and incredible sense of despair.

The Courtyard~
A deteriorating and long abandoned construction of stones and gems, the
courtyard is a ghostly reminder of the property's former beauty.  In the
courtyard's center is a large water fountain with a statue of an angel,
frozen in a pirouette, sculpted atop it.  Dead trees droop over from their
large clay pots, and on to the floor.  Dust covers every inch of here.

Dank, stale air permeates here, another indication of the property's
abandonment.  Large cobwebs stand as guards, stretching themselves from the
ground to the cement ceiling, as if trying to keep any newcomer from
venturing any further.  Although there is no sign of life anywhere, a
haunting moan echoes against the Hallway walls.

A chamber that was once used as a hiding place for the property's

rust.  In the corner of the chamber is a small bed, fit for one person, and
there is a desk adjacent to it.  A small stove has been built into here, and

A very sudden and very noticeable contrast to the Hallway's darkness, the
entrance to what appears to be an impeccable mansion is anything but dark
and demure.  A large chandelier hangs overhead and a grand oak table sits
right beneath it, with a golden vase of violets resting upon it.  A small
orchestra plays in the left corner of the entrance, playing soft music.

corridor walls, each one bearing a rare and beautiful bird within it.  In
between the bird cages are large porceline vases of fresh flowers, some in
full bloom, others still in the budding stages.  The decorum is both tacky
and tasteful, and yields a strange sense of freedom in its placement.

Bright yellow and white strobe lights quickly flash by, and several
hysterical women are screaming at the top of their lungs as they wildly
fling countless pieces of money onto a stage.  And it is quickly realized
why the women are acting so outrageous: large, muscular, and finely tanned
male strippers crowd onto the lit stage, dancing forbiddenly to erotic
music.  They coolly walk before the excited women, tossing their clothing at
them and modesty accepting the monetary donations.  The room itself is less
erotic, simply furnished with a few sofas and a blue colored rug.  Small
coffee tables lie between the couches, all of them piled high with empty
alcohol bottles.

here is unlike the previous one experienced at the property's entrance. 
Somehow, it feels more alive.

Atop the stage four scantily clad women move in rather erotic motions,

very good looking stripper, who satisfies his or her customer with a highly
sexual lap dance.  There is an occasional hoot or cheer of pleasure, but a
general silence from the concentrating customers gives this room an eerie
feeling.  The atmosphere is intense, and all eyes focus only on the body
which they have purchased.

occur behind closed and guarded doors, the only person with the door key is

and rather contemporary furnishings.  Oblong chairs have been places besides
the closed doors, more as a decoration than a piece of furniture.  A simple,
round golden flower vase filled with dried baby's breath lies on the floor,
untouched.  The only sounds here are the sounds of the couples in the room,
locked away from curious eyes.  South of the sentinel is the door to the

Decorated only by the light of candles, dedicated to the goddess with

of the bordello.  Statues of Aphrodite seem to have been thoughtlessly
tossed about the hallway, positioned in places that either block the pathway
or make the pieces of art hard to view all together.  But despite the
strangeness of the decorum, the hallway still emits an atmosphere of love
and honesty, a true irony for such a sinful house.

Despite the mansion being dedicated to the pursuit of lust and
gratification, there is one room dedicated to the pleasure of recreation. 
There are several customers here, all of them enjoying a competitive game of
pool with a few of the busty hostesses that roam around the room.  Above
each of the tables are low lights that only illuminate the table, and
nothing else.  It is no surprise that a few of the men have taken advantage
of the privacy, often times using the pool tables for more than just playing
a game of balls and sticks.

love, an incredible irony to what the whole mansion stands for.  The only
decorum here is the candles, which have been aligned to form a sort of path.
Within the hall are numerous statues of the goddess Aphrodite, sculpted in
numerous themes and positions.  They have been places in random areas, some
in the middle of the walkway, others wedged in a corner.  It is a most
unconventional, yet artistically stimulating, hall.

to those who wish to travel down further into the mansion's core.  Their

a large crystal chandelier hangs from the ceiling.

A Corridor~
The Corridor ends here, and a new section of the mansion begins.  The
large paintings have been replaced by expensive and colorful tapestries, all
of them made out of fine silk.  There is a statue of a couple engaging in
ardent lovemaking at a far corner of the hall, and rose petals have been
placed at their feet.  To the north, more soft music can be heard.

{CForbidden Lair{x~
The Bordello's most infamous chamber, Sappho's Lair is the most popular
room for male voyeurs.  Here, every single night, men gather in this oval
shaped room to watch women make love.  There is a large bed in the middle of
the oval, and sofas are lined up along the walls for comfortable viewing. 
Soft lighting adds to the feeling of erotica.

A Corridor~
Decorated in rich and expensive accessories, beaming with the softness
of the overhead lights, the corridor is just an introduction to the
mansion's opulence.  On the walls hang incredible paintings framed in gold,
and lined up against the walls are mable pillars, each one bearing a
significant artifact from the world's history.  There is a sense of wonder,
history, and radiance emanating through the corridor walls.

A Vestibule~
A golden hallway is laid out before you, simply decorated yet still as
opulent as the previous halls.  Marble tiles patterned in dolphin-grey veins
line the floor, their polished surfaces reflecting the bright light of a
crystal chandelier hanging overhead.  Large glass pane windows are on both
sides of the hallway, and sheer purple curtains cascade down their fronts. 
Soft music plays here from an unknwon source, and it is surprisingly serene.

{YPhilara's Bedroom{x~
Painted in whites and baby blues, it looks nothing like the room of an
infamous bordello owner.  A comfortable bed is situated off to the right
side, covered in a canopy of white curtain.  On the left side is a beautiful
varnished desk and a red horse hair chair.  In the center of the whole room
is what appears to be a throne of some sort, encrusted in jewels and
precious metals.  The entire back wall is a painting of Philara herself,
poised upon the crook of a tree, gazing out into the sea.

{5S{%e{5c{%r{5e{%t {5P{%l{5e{%a{5s{%u{5r{%e{5s{x~
A hidden room that is known only to the wealthiest and most valued
customers at the bordello, it is quickly realized why such a room is kept
secret.  On the walls hang suggestive toys and props, each one designed to
satisfy the most outrageous fetishes and wildest fantasies.  A very large
bed lies in the center of the room, and four stands have been set up at each
of the bed's corners.  Inside each stand is a single unlit incense candle. 
Paintings of sexual positions literally cover the walls in a sort of gaudy
display of physical gratification.  A small bouquet of roses has been left
on the bed.

{BLara's {CGift {BShoppe{x~
A quaint little boutique has been set up here, and a very pretty young
lady stands behind the counter, greeting you with a friendly smile.  All
around are glass racks neatly displaying various brands of health potions
and contraceptives, there are even small baskets of samples laid out for the
cautious buyer.  On the counter top is a small stack of brochures lying
beside a well groomed bonzai tree.
