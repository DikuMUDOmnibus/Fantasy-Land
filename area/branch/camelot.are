comfort permeates you. A deep fatherlike voice says "Now that Arthur is 
dead, it is up to you to right what he wrought. Seek out and destroy Mordred 
and Morgan Le Fey. They are destroying Camelot." The voice and the light 
gradually fade leaving you with only a lingering warm feeling.

You stand in the fabled court of Camelot. Here in the sunny courtyard noblemen
and knights walk barefoot in the grass discussing chivalry and wars to come.
Troubadours play ballads on their lutes and entertainers hop and leap into the
air all for a chance of earning the kings favor. Ladies in waiting play their
love games with young knights and squires. The whole world seems like a much
better place here, where friendship thrives and the high ideals of chivalry
breathe.  You have a commanding vantage of the Tourney Yard of Camelot from
here.  Exits lead to the knights barracks, the round table, the feast hall,
and the tourney yard of Camelot.

in full armor and a bright orange plume. To the right is a knight in chain 
mail and a trailing black cape. Arthur signal's the knights with a short wave.
The both knights spur their warhorses into a full gallop. To your right you
hear a squeal of delight from a spectator. The black caped knight leans into
his charge with his weight forward and in a low stand on his stirrups. 
Both knights collide in the center of the yard with a resounding crash. The
orange plummed knight contorts in his saddle, delivering a thrust high on 
the shield of the black caped knight. The black caped knight connects with a
hard shot to the center of the shield of the orange knight. You watch the 
orange knight fly and land with a sickening crash on the yard. The black
knight circles and raises his lance in a salute to Arthur.

of Camelot as far as you gaze. But most of all you notice the large

An Outpost~
You are in the outpost for the wall. It is a stone keep, with little in the 
way of creatur comforts. There are barracks and a main hall. Guards are 
posted along the wall. Your arrival has been a source of great interest, 
as these bordermen don't see many people.

Scots Keep~
You are in the speldor of a Scots keep. Walls are draped with animal hides.
Women and children are sprawled among pallets of skins and hides. A great 
roaring fire blazes in a huge stone hearth, taking the chill from your 
bones. The men were doing a dance involving leaping over swords, but they 
have stopped since you are here. There is a big iron pot warming from a 
chain in the fire.

Farms~
You have spent a day travelling though the breadbasket of Camelot, following 
a cobble stone road. The fields are producing well this year, and the 
peasants are out harvesting a bountiful crop. Soon the harvest end festivals 
will begin and all will celebrate another fine year. In fact you have 3 
invitations for various festivals from the people you have met along the 
way.

Farms~
You have spent a day travelling though the breadbasket of Camelot, 
following a cobble stone road. This paticular section of farms is not 
doing as well, as signs of raiding and pillaging abound here. The peasants 
seem to be bouncing back, and the fields are once again with crop. To 
the west is a heavily travelled muddy road, and the fields continue to 
the east and north.

Angle Raid!~
You are in the whirling chaos of an Angle raid on this farming village.
Farmers are defending themselves from the raiders with their farm tools.
Women are gathering the children and running north. Some unlucky women 
are being raped by the brutish Angles, who are so named for the long 
angled polearm they use. The village is on fire, and you can make out 
the raider ship on the shore to the west.

An Outpost~
You have reached a fortified outpost. Your boots sink in the mud which 
is rutted and groved by the supply wagons which come her.
You talk to the guards and they warn you of the merciless Picts to the 
west, with whom Camelot is at war. The men are hardened by warfare, and 
stare at you with eyes that have seen terrible atrocity. To the east are 
farms, and to the west you hear the terrible clash of war.

Battle!~
You have boldly entered the heart of a raging battle between the knights 
of Camelot and the barbaric Picts. The knights have set up a skirmish 
line across the field, spreading out the Picts, while two calvary units 
are sweeping around the ends in a pincher like move. Holding the center 
of the line are several knights of reknown. The Picts are faring badly, 
as their leader has already left the field in cowardly retreat.

Stables~
You stand in the vast stables of Camelot. Row upon row of stalls greet 
your eye. Smells of horse sweat and fresh straw combine in a pleasant mix. 
Stable hands are busy currying animals, shoeing horses, and feeding the 
magnificant chargers of Camelot. Light filters in through the rafters. 
To your west is Knight's Way.
