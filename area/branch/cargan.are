Before A Village in Ruins~
You are now standing outside what seems to be a village in ruins.  The
structure outside the building appears extremely aged and battered as
several missing layers of bricks and cracks fill the outer portions.  A flag
standing on the towers to the left and right are tattered.  It appears a war
might have swept through this once foretold beautiful village.  Old gates to
the east are somewhat open for you to head into.  
 
A huge barricade stands to the west of you preventing anyone to head out.

A strange darkness and eerie quietness seems to surround you as the
strangely cold gates creak as you enter.  The once magnificent textures of
the brick road here is now cracked, aged and destroyed from what would look
like a battle of some sort took place within this establishment.  A steady
breeze begins to blow through here as the shattered bricks pave its way
eastward while the old gates exiting the once animated village leaves to the
west.

walls here furnished with many abstract writings.  Several of these are

Inside the Eastern Gates~
Welcome to the ruins!  Activity in this town has been conquered by forces
of evil!  Travellers use to come from distant lands in hopes of establishing
shelter and other things but visually all has fallen!  The ground beneath
you has shattered as gates from beside you have ripped and been broken into.
A dead end is seen to the far west where more of the damage delivered can be
seen in the Cargan Ruins.

Before the East Gates of A Village~
You are now standing outside the opened gates on what is known as the
ruins of Carga.  The structure on the outer walls have been broken into as
if a huge explosion tattered deep inside the city.  Long poles from flags
perched on the towers lie about as a trail away from here is visible to the
east.

A Western Turn~
This short walkway turns into the west deeper into the ruins.  Several
portraits are found lying on the floor here.  Knocked candles lie near your
feet as broken pieces of marble lie about defacing the whole place.

A Curved Streetway~
The street suddenly curves to the east as the path itself takes you near
the eastern gates of Carga.  Directions south and north are visible.  Not
much is to describe here but a cold breeze flowing through.

Northeast Main Street~
The once well-paved street here was layered with fine brick textures
providing a smooth ride through here.  Now the road has been destroyed
immensely and travel is very rough along these streets.  A path goes north
and west through these streets as you frown at the sight of this once
beautiful town.

A Room Full of Broken Weapons~
A broken furnace on the northern end of the shop stands dusty and worn
out.  Broken materials from the ceiling fall to the floor as many of the
weapons displayed along the walls are now destroyed and broken in half. 
Sprays of blood lie about with several skulls lying about.  A SIGN hangs on
the wall for you to see.

I apologize once more."

allow travellers to move easily here.  The ground is somewhat scattered with
soil as a janitor is in need to sweep up the road here.  The flow of traffic
here paces fairly as people move about in typical fashion.  The streets
