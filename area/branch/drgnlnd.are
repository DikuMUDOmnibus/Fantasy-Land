Entrance to the Valley Pass~
As you make your way down the trail, you notice it widens and becomes
more beaten in.  The fragrant scent of wild flowers tickle yours nose as
you make your way further down the path.  It appears to lead into a valley
of some sort, though you cannot see what lies at the end of the trail.
A weather-faded oak sign must have been jammed into the ground a long
time ago, but it still appears to be readable.

The Valley Pass~
As you wander down the trail, you feel oddly at peace with
your surroundings.  The warbling of a far off bird only seems to
aid in the serenity this place is bringing you.  A {Ccool{x breeze
sweeps by, refreshing you.  Off to the north, you can make out the
remnants of a campsite. Your curiosity piqued, you hurry along.

The Remains of a Campsite~
A burnt out campfire and two forked sticks stuck into the ground
are all that remain of the campsite.  You pause, sensing something is wrong.
You whirl about, weapons drawn, ready to face whatever foe has decided to
ambush you.  As it turns out, it's just a harmless looking doe.  She sniffs
at you, then turns and bounds away, before you can even react.  Chuckling at
your own paranoia, you turn back to the burnt out campfire, and notice a
small diary half buried in the dirt nearby.

Along the Valley Pass~
Steadfast and resilient, you keep along the trail.
Oddly enough, there seem to be no trees here. Just shrubbery
and chaparal.  The trail is less defined here, as well. A
dark shape flickers across the ground about 20 paces ahead of
you.  A shadow, but a very large one. You look up at the sky
to see what could cast such a large shadow, but find it nothing
but empty, not even a single cloud.

A bend in the trail~
The trail begins a rather steady descent from here,
although it hardly seems to make a difference.  A steady
breeze picks up, from behind you.  It's almost as if it
was pushing you along.  Shrugging your shoulders, you
continue along the path.

The {CC{cry{Ws{cta{Cl {GP{gas{Ys{gag{Ge{x~
Shimmering bands of color seem to dazzle you as you step
into this erstwhile invisible clearing.  The  soft crunching 
of glass being broken underfoot is all you can hear.  Wait, 
you can hear something else.  It sounds like a faunt humming, 
but very high pitched. Every time you turn your head, the colors 
shift.  The rocks and boulders, plants and yes, even small
animal life seem to be frozen, locked into eternal translucent 
crystal.  You shudder, wondering what wonderously horrible magic
could do this.  Off to the north, you notice the trail returns to normal.

In the Valley Pass~
Travelling along, you return to more mundane surroundings,
breathing a sigh of relief as you do.  However beautiful that
place was, you doubt you would want to be around when whatever
did that came back. The trail continues it's steady descent
towards the north.

The Valley Pass~
The path widens out considerably, and a massive plain
comes into view, with each step north, you can see more and
more.  As you stare off into the horizon, you think you can
make out the vague shape of a castle of some sort.

Nearing the end of the Path~
A {bchilling{x wind sweeps down from the south, nearly
knocking you onto your face.  Shivering, you behold the massive
plain before you.  The powerful wind sweeps the waist high grass
around, whipping it about.  To the west you see a forboding looking
mountain, and to the north a Large castle, and a small town nearby.
The ground is bare here, as well as to the west. A sense of
apprehension fills your soul as you stand here.
