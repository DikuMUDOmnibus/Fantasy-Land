time (80%), this aspect is a male, with flaming beard and moustache.  The
female version has flowing, fiery red hair.  Both aspects have glowing
yellow eyes that sometimes switch to fluorescent green.  The lower torso is
that of a large snake, with orange coloring shading to dull red at the tail
end.  The entire body is covered with wispy appendages that appear to burn
but are never consumed.

A Tightly Fit Room~
The monstrous steel door to your south suddenly seals SHUT!  The air
around you suddenly feels shiverishly cold..  Like silent death.  A small
white misty cloud begins to surround you..  Almost like a stench of fog. 
The walls around you are stone-layered and sealed close almost squishing
you.  The only form of light provided in here is the gray skies high high
above you where a hole in the cavern is seen about 50 feet up.  A small
shaft lies in the southwestern corner of the room with a dangling rope
tightly hanging on a huge steel ring sealed to the floor.  This provides the
only exit other than the locked door to your south.

signs of trouble.  You almost trip over something in the center of the room.
 
Suddenly a monstrous voice yells, 'WELCOME TO EARTH REALM!'
