Path through a Forest~
You have started down a small forest path.  Its made of gravel and
doesn't look like it leads anywhere that you could find on a map.  The smell
of pine trees is in the air, mostly because this is a pine forest.  The
trees look majestic and very old, almost wise.  The light dims as you walk
further along the path.

Path through a Forest~
You have entered a forest.  The trees are mostly large majestic pines,
they look almost as if they're alive.  If these trees could talk, they'd
probably tell you the meaning of life.  As you walk farther into the forest,
the sounds of animals become more and more prominent.  A high pierced shriek
comes from the trees, a song bird seems to be angry with something.  South
is the entrance to the forest and the path continues north.

Path through a Forest~
You are walking down a small path near the edge of a forest.  Animals
shriek, and hiss, and growl, very rarely you can even catch a few of them
peeking their heads out of a bush or running wildly across the path.  The
trees here look like they've been stripped of their bark, the odd thing is
they seem to be unharmed by it, there must be a person who really knows
nature living around here.  Weird chittering noises come from the west and
the path leads north and south.

The ground gives way beneath you and you FALL!  Looks like someone placed
a trap here to catch something.  You sure hope it isn't you.  Little
brownies dance up at the top of the pit and taunt you, that explains the
chattering, but not the hole itself, they are far too small to make it.

You are walking along a small path towards the edge of a forest.  The
trees start to get tall here, and the foilage is starting to become more
thick.  It's starting to get dark as well as the shade looms to something
seen at the east of here.  Tall trees block out the light as several birds
chitter up in the trees.  The path continues north and south.

Holy Glade~
You pass through a large overgrowth of bushs into the most beautiful
place you've ever seen.  The trees form a ring around a small crystal pool,
they look young and healthy, in fact their the first things that look young
that you've seen in this forest.  The small pool shines and you can see your
relection clearly in it if you look.  Animals cluster around it, lapping up
the cool water with their tongues, they don't seem scared of you here,
almost as if this place has some mystical power.  Theres some sort of door
the trees are forming to the north, you suddenly notice it as you stare at
the trees.

large animal like a bear to your east.  Its starting to get very dark,
because the trees are blocking out the suns rays.  The trees here also get
taller, and overlap, creating odd clumps of pine needles, that look like
they've grown together.  The path continues north and south.

Path through a Forest~
You are walking down a small path.  Its almost so dark you can't see your
hands here.  The trees around you look very eerie, they are gnarled and look
almost like they have strange evil faces.  You can hear the shrill cries of
owls and a rustling sound as they lift off into the air from their tree top
perches.  East and west are two very odd looking trees. Did you just see
something scurry up them?  North and south, the path continues.

growls doesn't sound too happy.  The only exit is west back onto the path.

look much less frightening and more peaceful, they are still the wise
looking pine trees you thought they were when you first entered this forest.
The calls of song birds can once again be heard, and every once in awhile a
deer walks into the path and runs away.

Below a Large Tree~
You are standing under a huge pine tree.  Its so high, it looks like its
branches at the top, are touching the moon.  You can only barely make out
the leaves on the branches, so it looks like the tree is gnarled at the top.
Looking closer at the trunk, it looks as if someone has carved hand holds
into it.  A rustling at the top draws your attention, is someone up there? 
You could go up the tree or west back to the path.

you've ever seen.  Its leaves can barely be seen, and as you look up you
suddenly feel very insignificant standing next to such an object of power
and beauty.  As you look closer at the trunk, you can see little foot holds
carved into it.  You could go up the trees or east back onto the path.

at the top.  All you can see is the green tops of other, smaller trees when
you look forward, and the sun when you look up.  When you look down,
everything looks very small and dark. It also looks as if your very high up,
so you better be careful.  Behind you little muscular men are talking in
strange languages, they don't seem happy to see you.  The only exit is down.

the way ahead.  The trees around here also seem to be blocking the way
ahead, it's almost as if the plants are protecting something.  There must be
a way ahead though, mostly because you can hear the trickle of running
water.  The sound of a bird pierces the silence here, and a deer runs in
front of you.  The only obvious exit is south, back onto the path.

You have passed through the weird door made out of trees.  The wird thing
about it is, you are in a clearing with a temple in the middle of it.  This
place cannot be found on any map, and theres no foresto be seen seen except
west.  The forest should have miles more trees towards the east, but all
their is, is grass.  The temple stands majestically, made of pure white
marble.  East is toward the odd temple and west is back into the holy glade.

You are standing on the stesp to a beautiful temple.  The walls are made
of pure white marble, and so are the gates.  Its gates tower up before you,
it almost looks like heaven.  No guards stand at the gates, and no sounds
come from within.  It seems like a place like this should have choirs of
angels singing around it, but there seems like theres something wrong.  West
is beyond the forest door and east is inside the temple.

beautiful marble walls and gorgeous paintings.  Little demonic creatures run
around killing the poor helpless priests, they have taken a vow of silence. 
Satanic laughter can be heard coming from the halls, as one by one the
priests are killed.  North , chanting can be heard, and south, you can see
the priest's rooms.  West is outside the temple.

on mats, mumbling chants and prayers to their god, as they are brutally
killed by little demonic creatures.  Blood splatters most of the mats, and

it away from the kitchen when the other priests weren't looking.  The straw
bed is messed up and claw marks cover the walls.  There is evidence of a

get under it, but it provides mighty good shade from the sun.  Beyond the
needles you can see up at the top of the tree, and house cut into its side. 
A rope ladder hangs down from it, unlike the other houses where the ladders
are hanging from the trunk.  Up is the house and east is the elven village
clearing.

Bridge Over Thri'Khan Spring~
You are walking across a bridge, over a peaceful spring.  The animals
don't move from drinking it as you approach, but keep on lapping up water. 
The bridge is beautiful worksmanship, its made entirely of pine, which still
has its smell to it.  Busy elves scurry across the bridge, staring at you
for a second, but then shrugging it off and moving on.  You can see the rope
bridge and houses above you, some elves are staring at you from up there. 
North continues through the wild elf village and south does too.

An Elven Grocery~
This isn't a house at all but an elven grocery store.  Dried meat and
fruits hang from hooks behind the shelf and nuts are in jars on shelves. 
Theres a mat on the floor where the shop keeper sleeps, so this is a house
in a way.  The shop keeper smiles at you until he notices how tall you are
and then your ears, after that he looks puzzled.  Hem ay not understand your
language, but he sure understands your coins.  Down is beneath this tree and
east is the rope bridge.

An Elven Armor Shop~
Standing in an elven armor shop, you notice two things about it.  It
doesn't have a forge like most of the weapon shops you've seen, and all the
weapons are wooden.  Bows and poison tipped arrows hang from hooks behind
the shelf, and wooden spears sit against the walls.  The shop keeper has a
bed behind his counter, so this shop is his house as well as his work place.
West is a rope bridge and down is beneath the tree.  Theres an oven in the
corner, and the smell of fudge wafts out of it.

Rope Bridge~
You are standing on a well-made rope bridge, which connects all the tree
houses together.  You can see the whole village and some of the forest from
up here.  The spring below and alittle north looks as clear as glass even
from this height.  A few elves stare at you from below as they notice your
heighth and that your ears aren't pointy, but they decide not to pry.  Two
shops are east and west, and south is more of the rope bridge.  North also
goes to more rope bridge.

Below A Huge Tree~
You are below a tree in the center of the village.  The tree is a large
redwood, its trunk is about the width of five titan standing together.  It
houses the biggest building in the village, which is the town hall.  The
town hall is connected by ropes to all the buildings in the city, and its an
honor for elves to serve as councilman in it.  A rope ladder about one
hundred feet long goes up their humoungus tree to the hall.  More houses are
east and west, and south is a bridge over the spring.

Entrance to the Town Hall~
You are standing at the entrance to the town hall of this village.  You
can hear loud talking, even shouting coming from it, and its in a language
you don't quite understand.  This is the highest point in the whole forest
so you can see all the trees tops and even to the plains outside the forest.
The elves down below look like ants almost, and you can't even see the
animals.  A bird flys past your head, you are really high up!  North is
inside the town hall and south is the rope bridge.  West and east are rope
bridges to the houses east and west.

Underneath a Tree~
You are standing underneath a large oak tree, which suddenly seems
dwarfed by the huge redwood you see off to the east.  It still looks
majestic and beautiful though.  The house above in the tree is carved out of
the very wood from the tree its in.  A rope bridge going from this tree
house rises all the way up to that huge redwood to the east.  A sign hangs
from the edge of the trunk, near the rope bridge which leads up to the
house.  Up is the house and west is the center of this village.

Underneath a Tree~
You are standing below a enormous oak tree.  It seems it is the second
largest tree in this village.  How ironic that one of the smallest houses in
the village is at the top.  The house looks very dishevelled and old.  From
what you can see of it, it seems even the bridge is falling apart.  You can
hear screaming coming from the house, the language isn't yours, but you can
sure understand a mad person's crys.  Up is the house and east is the
humoungous redwood.

sheets made of an unknown faber is on the edge of the room, and the curtains
are made of the same.  A shelf filled with the finest conversation pieces
and gold statues is on the opposite side.  Theres an impoirted rug on the
ground too.  This house must definitely belong to an important elf here.

You are standing in the house of a mad man.  What little furniture that
was in here is demolished, and the whole house is practically destroyed. 
The house's only occupant moshes around the room insanely, yelling
incoherently and lashing out at anything that moves.  Every once in awhile
he gains a moment of lucidity and talks to you in the elven language but
then goes back to running around wildly.  Down is below the tree and east is
the Rope Bridge.

holds a hammer of some sort.  He bangs it whenever theres too much shouting
He seems to be the lord of this town and has an air of royalty about him,
even if he wears to same forest green clothes as the rest of the elves.  The

You are standing in the part of this village where the elves keep their
public facilitys.  Instead of having them up in the tree houses, they put
them in hollowed out trees accessable from ground level.  You can spot more
elves walking around here, going into the facilitys to use whatever
materials they can get from them.  Theres still no visible path and animals
still run free in the village, afterall elves are very close with nature. 
East and west are hollowed out trees.  North is the end part of the village
and south is a huge redwood.

By a Tree~
You are standing outside a hollowed out tree with a door.  The trees
another tall oak, looks very old and wise.  Maybe it soaked up the wisdom
inside its trunk, because from what you can make out of the wild elven
language a sign on the door says, Library.  The door is oddly enough, made
of metal, the actual houses in this village are made of wood.  Maybe the
elves prize knowledge over their own lives.  East is inside the tree and
west is in the middle of the village.

darkness here, it feels like this area is in perpetual night.  The path

Path to the Altar~
Your walking down a path to the temple altar.  The light is very dim and
theres blood splattered on every part of the carpet and walls.  As you walk
along you realize the hall has an intersection here, and everything is
starting to look the same.  You've become lost in the temple!

Hellfire~
A large explosion rocks you as you enter this room.  Fire and blood are
everywhere covering the whole room.  Most of the furniture has been broke or
burned to a crisp and theres a huge fiery shape in the middle of the room. 
You think you've probably met a demonic guardian.

The Altar Room~
You are standing in the altar room.  The white marble walls are burnt and
covered with the blood of priests.  Pews are overturned and destroyed, where
people once sat in worship.  The altar is overturned as well and its also
broken in two.  Another altar to a dark god has been erected and demons
stand around it with bloody knives ready to sacrifice a priest when the head
demon gives the order.  The only exit is west.

The Spring~
You wade inside the cool spring.  The water is so clear you can see your
toes at the bottom and the mud is very soothing to your feet.  Other
animals, such as frogs and fish swim around you, seemingly unafraid, they
must be used to elves.  The only exit is west, onto the bridge.

Flower Shop~
You are standing in a small flower shop.  The scent of perfume and roses
wafts into your nose as you stand here.  Flowers, both cut and uncut are
lined out in pots behind the counter.  The little old lady runs the shop
here, she gets flowers from all over the place, including the rare fire
flower.  The only exit is west.
