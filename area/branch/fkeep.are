avatar of 1st Draconian ArchMage~
The Avatar of the first Draconian ArchMage is here!
~
This is the undead avatar of the very first Draconian ArchMage!  He calmly
stares at you and snickers that you would come this far with so little help.
He is obviously the cause for all the strange weather lately, but why was there 
fire and ice, yet no real lightning?

a wild templar~
A wild templar is here, ranting over your trespassing!
~
This templar obviously is disfavorable upon trespassers here
in the tower.  His ranting and chiming of spells is disturbing
especially amongst the echoes of fanaticists chanting.

A ranting mage is here casting spells facetiously!
~
It's quite obvious by the continual failings of his attempted spells

it's better for you should his spell deviate from it's target.

of his murderer and current Avatar of Death, Destruction and Chaos....

Passage of the Avatar~
You have reached the final passage to the Avatar of the keep. Hopefully,
you will be successful in your quest and become a greater legend than he.
Very few have traveled as far, and very fewer have lived to tell their
tale.

Chamber of the WarLord~
This is the Chamber of the Protector of the Avatar.  No one is allowed to
proceed further without the permission of the Keep's WarLord. Hopefully,
you can either persuade or sneak by him when he is making his rounds, or
disposing of his last trespasser.

Chamber of the Avatar~
You have reached the Chamber of the reigning Avatar.  Very few have ever 
laid eyes upon this room.  Judging by the number of skulls displayed as
trophies...even fewer have ever left this room.  Hopefully, yours will not
be his next prize.

The top of Infinity~
A Mystical Waterfall of IceWine bubbles from the ground here and spills over
the side of the mountain.  You would think the view here would be better, but
you're over the 5th layer of clouds and all you see is white.  Far below is a
ledge... Dare you risk the jump?

Icewine is bubbling over the edge here!  You can't get close enough
to drink any unless you jump!~

Rama's Pond~
You are at the highest place in all the realms. Rama's Pond sits here in
its own sparkling radiance. This place used to be the home of the Immortal
Ducks of all the realms, but now only Rama is left and he protects the
realms from the evil hunters that populate these parts.
