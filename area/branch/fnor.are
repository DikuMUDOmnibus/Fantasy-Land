The {^s{6ha'{^T{6ayan {^M{6ashiara {^S{6edai{x favors you with a warm smile.
~
A beautiful woman stands before you, smiling down at you from
a crystalline pedestal. Her eyes are of a warm gold and speak of the
gentleness within her soul. Long copper curls cascade down her back
to her waist, and are held back from her forehead by a thin silver
band. Her smile is soft and elegant, dulcet and pure, and instantly puts
you at ease. Silken robes, intricately embroidered with leaves, vines
and flowers, embrace her body, cinched at the waist with a silver-linked
belt. Delicate pale hands reach out to you, imploringly, seeking to
heal and comfort, to bless and succor.
The {^s{6ha'{^T{6ayan{^ is in the eternal service of her lord and master,
Kurr DelaCruz.

lightly fluted sides. Both edges keened down to perfect lines, invisibly
sharp. Perfection like this could of only been forged by a god. The black
hilt is contrasted only by the faint symbol of a dragon head.
Apon the blade is engraved a poem:

                      Dragonslicer, Dragonslicer, how d'you slay?
                      Reaching for the heart in behind the scales.
                      Dragonslicer, Dragonslicer, where do you stay?

Always there with a smile

not letting it get him down

people would greet him with smiles
loved and appriciated very much
his kindness could go for miles

Chock full of jokes
and filled to the brim with charm
he gave everybody a chance
and a fly he would never harm

With an odd twinge, followed by a pop, you find yourself standing in a
dimly lit, smokey room. Elaborately inlaid teak floor panels rest under
your feet, bearing not a single scratch. Gold flecked black marble tiles
line the walls, almost seeming to absorb the already dim light - you can't
even see your reflection, though you're sure the tiles are polished. Strange
incense fills your nose, making your head spin ever so softly. As your eyes
adjust to the dark you can make out furniture.  A few chairs, and a desk in
the corner.  Candles light fill the room with their fragile glow, soft yellow,
blue, and orange light spraying faint ephemeral color everywhere. As you look
up, you notice a gaping hole in the roof, crystals arranged around the rim.
Moonlight seems to gather there, beaming the light down into a pool that
collects on dais covered with soft velvet cushions.

{DThe doorway you had just walked through disappeared.  You stand in an
infinite void.  The glittering stars of eternity glimmer below you, so
faintly.  You have to choke back a tear every time you stare down at it.  A
choking sense of emptiness fills you, and you long to be close to someone.

others.  The walls are adorned with large, beautiful paintings {8ill{7umin{&ated{0

extremely painful deaths at the hands of a beautiful woman.  There appears
to be a new painting in the process of being created.  It even has your face.

Melodie's Secret Room~
Somehow you've entered Melodie's private room.  You hear an Italian Opera
aria playing in the background.  The walls are covered in a light pink
satin, and there is a window on the north wall looking out onto La Coeur de
la Mer.  Under the window stands an oversized couch overflowing with
pillows.  There is a beautiful white grand piano in the corner with pictures
in intricate frames along the lid.  In the opposite corner stands a
high-backed rosewood chair with violet velvet cushions.  Next to the chair
is a table with some books on it.  At a closer glance you realize that they
are not ordinary books - they are scores from different operas and musicals.
You hear a soft vibrating coming from the piano.  Looking at the bench, you
