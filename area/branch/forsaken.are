{0Arklonnh, {8ex-gladiator {wfrom the slave pits of {RD{1r{Ya{3j {0is here.{x
~
{wBorn from the unlikely parentage of dwarves and humans, muls combine
the height{x {wand adaptable nature of humanity with the musculature and
resilience of dwarvenkind.  {x {wTypically, muls enjoy greater physical
strength and endure greater periods of physical{x {wlabor than either humans
or dwarves.  Muls also possess a few traits that are uniquely their{x {wown,
such as their astonishingly robust metabolism and almost inexhaustible
{wcapacity for work.  The hybrid has disadvantages in a few areas as well. 
{wMuls are sterile and have a shorter lifespan than either parent race.  {x
{wArklonnh was rescued from his horrid life of slavery by the leaders of
Forsaken, who happened to end up in the hot world of Athas{x {wduring their
visits to other planes.  Grateful for the assistance, Arklonnh decided to
settle down somewhat and devote himself to Forsaken and his friends.  {x
{wFor this, he has been granted and blessed with extended longevity.  {x

away, less menacing but no less deadly is the statue of the half-elf,
wearing simple elven chainmail and wielding a straight blade and a curving
one of equal size.  Both statues are in their traditional fighting stances
and poised to strike instantly to deliver an ambush, killing both body and
soul at the exact time.  Looks like there is only one way past.  Well, at
