Outside A Boarded Chamber Door~
The climb upward suddenly stops as a giant black chamber door is seen to the west.  A strange note is sealed on the door itself.
 
The rumbling has increased in magnitude!

Outside the Lair Door~
The tunnel carries to the north where brightness glows ahead.  Turning
around, you find nothing but a dead end to the south with no detection of a
door seen back in the lair of the black dragon.  You sense finally the end
of the hideous dragon caverns behind you.

The Mouth of the Dragon Cave's Exit~
The tunnel ends before you as the exit from this monstrous cavern is
finally gone.  The light from the outside world begins to focus into view as
a peaceful mood fills within you.  North of you leaves the cave for good.
