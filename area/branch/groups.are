-1 DWARF DWARVES~
{x
Dwarves are short, stocky demi-humans, known for foul temper and great
stamina.  Dwarves have high strength and constitution, but poor dexterity.
They are not as smart as humans, but are usually wiser due to their long 
lifespans.  Dwarves make excellent fighters and priests, but are very poor
mages or thieves.  Dwarves are extremely resistant to poison and disease, 
but cannot swim so are vulnerable to drowning.  They receive the berserk 
skill for free (if warriors), and can see in the dark with infravision.

-1 ELF ELVES~
{x
Elves are slightly taller than humans, but have a much lighter build.  They
lack the strength and stamina of the other races, but are far more agile,
both in body and mind.  Elves are superb mages and thieves, but have at
best fair talent as warriors or priests.  Elves resist charm spells most 
effectively, due to their magical nature.  However, they are burned by the 
touch of iron, and so are barred from the use of iron or steel in their 
adventuring careers.  Elves are notoriously hard to spot, and so elven 
warriors and thieves receive the sneak and hiding automatically.  They can 
also see in the dark pretty well.

-1 HUMAN HUMANS MAN~
{x
Humans are the most common race in the world, and make up the majority of
adventurers. Although they have no special talents like the other races,
they are more versatile, being skilled in all classes.  Humans are also 
able to gain more benefit from magical devices.

-1 GIANT GIANTS~
{x
Giants are the largest of the races, ranging from 9-12 feet in height.  They
are stronger than any other race, and almost as durable as the dwarves.  
They aren't too bright, however, and their huge size makes them more clumsy
than the other races.  Giants make the best warriors and are ill-suited at 
any other profession.  Giants resist heat and cold with nary a mark, due to
their huge mass.  However, their slow minds make them extremely vulnerable 
to mental attacks.  They are also pretty hopeless at avoiding lightning
strikes and are therefore vulnerable to them.  Due to their size and 
stamina, they receive the fast healing and bash skills for free. 
(Only giant warriors receive bash).

-1 PIXIE PIXIES~
{x
Pixies are very much like the elves...and share with them a vulnerability
to iron weapons.  They also share the nature-loving attitude and peaceful
demeanor, but beyond this pixies reach an extreme.  They are extremely
magical creatures which, unlike elves, fly everywhere they go.  Their
wings are fairly redundant, as they don't really use them to fly.  It's
the sheer magical nature of a pixie that gives it its special qualities.
They are a race of very small size, and because of their inquisitive
nature and mental power, tend also to be tinkerers and sometimes
pranksters.  Because of this they are resistant to mental energies and
also resist the efforts of would-be charmers.  While a pixie may be 
thousands of years old, almost all of them act like human children...

-1 HALFLING HALFLINGS~
{x
Halflings are a quiet folk who like to keep to themselves and are not
often seen filling the role of an adventurer.  They would much rather
sit complacently by a fireplace enjoying a good book, good drink and
good conversation.  They are, however, very adept thieves, and have the
mental capabilities to be quite powerful mages.  They are about half
as tall as the average human, thus the name halfling.  Because of this
small size and the fact that most devices are built to human proportions,
halflings are masters at lockpicking, disarming traps and jewel craft.
They also have very easy access to pockets, and there is no door a
halfling can not open and slip through with the utmost of silence.  Due
to this sneaky nature, halflings are endowed with sneak and hiding 
abilities.  They resist poison and disease but are vulnerable to light.

-1 HALFORC HALFORCS~
{x
Halforcs are a cross between humans and orcs, dwarves and orcs, or sometimes
even giants and orcs.  These various combinations are almost always the result
of an orc raid on the habitation of one of those other races, and each type of
halforc is just as mean and hearty as the other.  They are also very agile,
and born athletes, however seldom is a halforc found that can even read or
speak coherently and due to this they are vulnerable to mental attacks.  They 
are quite literally dumber than bricks, but there is no more fearsome fighter 
around.  A halforc is a warrior and if a halforc is not a warrior, then that 
halforc is useless.  They can fight, and when it suits them they can also 
sleep, eat and fornicate, but that's it.

-1 GOBLIN GOBLINS~
{x
Goblins are almost universally shunned because they are almost all natural
criminals, cutthroats and killers.  Every crime boss or thief master is a
goblin, with very few exceptions.  They are extremely thrifty, known to
argue over a single silver piece, and will drop water in the desert before
dropping money.  Goblins have diabolical minds and few torture devices can
be named which a goblin did not think up.  They are extremely smart and also
have a knack for survival.  Stealth comes naturally to them, and their dusky
grey to green, sometimes even blue or black, skin tones make them hard to
spot at night.  They resist mental attacks but are vulnerable to silver,
light, wooden and holy items.  Goblins are not really warlike, and don't 
really appreciate overt combat.  It is not their style.  A goblin would 
much rather satisfy its sadistic needs through thievery or betrayal than 
through honorable combat.

~

-1 HALFELF HALFELVES~
{x
Halfelves are a cross between a human and an elf, usually due to the fact
that human armies sometime make raids on elf lands. Halfelves are very
nearly human, although they tend to be a bit more thoughtful and less
physically powerful.  Unfortunately they are also more bitter, and much
more aloof than either the most secretive elf or the most secluded human
hermit.  They see themselves as unwelcome in either elf or human society
and as a result tend to lead solitary lives as wandering adventurers who
follow no real creed.  A halfelf is a natural loner, and most of them are 
rangers or druids, communing with the nature that they love much as the 
elves do.  They have much better eyesight than humans, due to their elven 
ancestry, but unlike elves, are more inquisitive about the world around 
them, much as humans are.

-1 AVIAN AVIANS~
{x
The avian race is a very secretive and mysterious one.  They are the size
of giants, towering over any human, but weigh about the same as an elf.
Their slight bone structure allows their wings to carry them as they fly
from place to place, but it also requires them to rely on mental prowess
instead of brawn for survival.  Their adeptness in the air makes them 
resistant to lightning attacks as they 'bounce' off the aura around them.
Many speculate the avians are a people who evolved in the mountains, 
perhaps magically.  However they came to be, they are fiercely religious 
and worship a nature deity.  Most choose to become druids since that 
allows them to be closest to their god, however they do well in clerical 
magicks as well.  They have uncanny powers of sight and it is said that 
an avian can see everything you do.  Their amazingly unusual bodies, which
basically look like emaciated humans with wings and the fact that they
are used to an isolated environment, makes them very susceptible to
disease and poison.  Many an avian has ventured out of his or her
homeland only to fall victim to one of the many plagues that ravage the
world at large.

-1 GNOME GNOMES~
{x
Gnomes are to dwarves what pixies are to elves.  That is to say, they are
smaller, smarter, less-strong cousins.  Where dwarves are known for their
mental dullness but great wisdom, gnomes are known for quick minds and a
very analytical nature.  They are nowhere near as strong or hearty as
dwarves are, but are much the same, being creatures of earth who can't
swim (and thus drown easily like dwarves) and have eyes attuned to seeing
in the dark.  Where a dwarf would see a mine shaft and its glittering
jewels, though, a gnome notices the girders and struts and supports within
the mine and contemplates ways to make them better.  Gnomes love technology,
metallurgy and any other form of science.  This makes them natural mages,
possessing mental powers that rival elves.  They are not, however, a stealthy
race like elves, goblins, or halflings.  They are engineers, architects,
artisans, and sometimes workers of great magicks.

-1 DRACONIAN DRACONIANS~
{x
The draconians are a fearsome race, and almost as secretive as the avians.
Like the avians, they can fly, and come from some not-so-well-known place
far away.  Unlike any other race though, draconians are not mammalian.
They more closely resemble lizards, snakes and especially dragons.
They tower over even giants in size, reaching over 12 feet in height, with
leathery wings that can stretch to over 30 feet when extended and can fold
up neatly on the back, causing no real hindrance in movement.  The sheer
size of a draconian DOES, however, cause problems, because most things in
the world are built with human size in mind.  Draconians are very strong,
and tougher even than dwarves.  Unlike most races that reach such large
proportions, they retain a keen mind and make good mages as well as
warriors.  Because of their strange biology, and some degree of reptilian
nature, draconians are immune to almost all poisons and plagues however
they are vulnerable to slashing and piercing weapons and also they dislike
lightning attacks.  They are, however, resistant to fire and cold.

-1 CENTAUR CENTAURS~
{x
Centaurs are woodland beings who shun the company of men.  They dwell in
remote, secluded glades and pastures.  The appearance of a centaur is
unmistakable: they have the upper torso, arms, and head of a human being,
and the lower body of a large, powerful horse.  Because of this powerful
nature, they are endowed with enhanced damage in combat.

{x
Gnolls are large, evil, hyena-like humanoids that roam about in loosely
organized bands.  While the body of a gnoll is shaped like that of a human,
the details are those of a hyena.  They stand erect on two legs and have
greenish grey skin, darker near the muzzle, with a short reddish grey to 
dull yellow mane.  They have good vision in the dark and can detect 
hidden creatures but they do have a vulnerability to silver.

-1 HEUCUVA HEUCUVAS~
{x
The heucuva is an undead spirit similar in appearance to a skeleton, but
more dangerous and more difficult to dispel.  The heucuva appears to be
a humanoid skeleton of normal size.  The bones are covered by a robe that
is little more than tattered rags.  These strange creatures are able to
see tantalizingly well in the dark and due to their undead nature, are
immune to all negative forms of energy, poison and disease.  They are
able to resist all weapon attacks and are born with a second attack.  
They are, however, vulnerable to all silver and holy items and they 
dislike light immensely.

-1 KENKU KENKUS~
{x
Kenku are bipedal, humanoid birds that use their powers to annoy and
convenience the humand and demihuman races.  The typical kenku resembles
a humanoid hawk wearing human clothing.  Kenku have both arms and wings.
The wings are usually folded across the back and may be mistaken at a
distance for a very large backpack.  Height ranges from 5 to 7 feet.
The feathers are predominantly brown with white underfeathers and face
markings.  The eyes are a brilliant yellow.  Due to their likeness to
hawks, they have keen eyesight.  They also have a good resistance to cold.

-1 MINOTAUR MINOTAURS~
{x
Minotaurs are either cursed humans or the offspring of minotaurs and
humans.  They usually dwell in underground labyrinths, for they are not
confused in these places, which gives them an advantage over their prey.
Minotaurs are huge, well over 7 feet tall, and quite broad and muscular.
They have the head of a bull but the body of a human male.  Their fur is
brown to black while their body colouring varies as would a normal human's.
Clothing is minimal, usually a loin cloth or skirt.  These large creatures
are immune to poison but vulnerable to blunt attacks.  They possess a
sharp eyesight and are also born with a natural ability for fighting.

-1 SATYR SATYRS~
{x
Also called fauns, satyrs are a pleasure loving race of half-human, half-goat
creatures.  They symbolize nature's carefree ways.  Satyrs have the torso,
head and arms of a man, and the hind legs of a goat.  The human head is
surmounted by two sharp horns that poke through the satyr's coarse, curly
hair.  The skin of the upper body ranges from tan to light brown with rare
individuals (1%) with red skin.  A satyr's hair is medium reddish, or dark
brown.  The horns and hooves are black.  Satyrs living near centaurs are
likely to be friendly with them.  Satyrs have keen eyesight and can detect
hidden creatures with ease.  They can also detect good and evil auras.
Satyrs are immune to fire but vulnerable to holy items and don't like the
light.  They resist negative energies completely.

{x
Titans are gargantuan, almost godlike men and women.  They, quite simply,
look like 25 foot tall people of great physical strength and beauty.  They
are commonly dressed in traditional Greek garb, favoring togas, loincloths,
and such.  They wear rare and valuable jewellery and in other ways make
themselves seem beautiful and overpowering.  Titans are very close to nature.
They also have keen eyesight and can detect items which can not be seen
with the naked eye.  They are quite immune to charm and resist the effects
of weapons against them, yet they have quite a powerful temper when roused.
They do, however, heal quicker than most.

-1 DROW~
{x
Drow are the evil cousins to the elves.  Drow have white hair and grey 
eyes, and like their cousins, they tend to be tall and lanky.  Due to 
living below ground, and due to the dangers of where they live, drow 
are reknowned for alertness and the ability to move silently.  Because
of the darkness of their homes, drow can see exceptionally well in the 
dark and are vulnerable to light.  They also have retained their cousins'
vulnerability to all items made of iron.  Drow make perfect thieves due
to their ability to sneak and hide and their skill in detection magics.
They also see through charmers and can resist this form of tricky 
exceedingly well.

-1 THEIWAR~
{x
Theiwars, otherwise known as "dark dwarves", are the distant relatives to 
the dwarves.  Theiwar live below ground, sharing their home with the drow.  
Much like the drow, they have become accustomed to living with the dangers 
of belowground life and have learned to move silently, as well as to wait, 
hidden, within rooms.  Theiwar are a magical race, and it is said that they
are well schooled in the realm of combat magicks.  Theiwars are an evil 
race, made so by the harshness of the underground tunnels in which they 
live, and are thus resistant to magic of evil design and cold but quite 
susceptible to holy magic.  Like Drow, Theiwars can see very well in the 
dark and are harmed greatly by light.

-1 CHANGELING~
{x
Changelings are magical creatures, part human and part cat.  These wondrous 
creatures have learned to combine the intelligence of the human with the 
gracefulness of the cat.  It has been said, that due to the magical aspects 
of this race, that they can suddenly disappear, only to reappear elsewhere.  
Because changelings are inherently magical, they take less damage from 
magic and poison than others, however, due to the cat in them, they hate 
water and cold and are easily drowned.  And like cats, they see exceedingly
well in the dark.

-1 SEA-ELF~
{x
Sea-elves are the elves of the ocean.  Sailors often confuse these beings 
with mermaids.  Like their land cousins, sea-elves are very intelligent and 
dextrous, thus they are gifted in the ability of sneaking and hiding.  They 
are also masters of illusion.  Their fine eyesight allows them to go 
largely undetected yet they are able to pick out hidden creatures with 
great success.  Due to the sea-elves' sheer ability in the water, they
are obviously fine swimmers and next to impossible to drown.  Due to the 
level of time they spend in the water, they have grown accustomed to the 
cold.  They have however retained their cousins' vulnerability to iron, 
as well as fire.

-1 CRYSTAL-DRAGON~
{x
Crystal dragons are the evil dragons of myth and lore.  These creatures
are huge, and terrible to behold.  Their high constitution and strength 
makes them mighty opponents, along with their inborn ability of attack 
and combat magics.  It is said that fire and lightning cannot be used to 
harm these creatures and that magic is less useful against them.  They 
are also highly resistant to disease and the trickeries of charm.  
Obviously being dragons, they can automatically fly and they have very 
sharp eyesight.

Silver dragons are the good counterparts to crystal dragons.  Also huge
in size, these dragons are beautiful to behold.  Their silver scales 
reflect the sunlight in an almost magical way, helping them to resist
all forms of magic.  They have keen eyesight and can see infrared and
also have sharp dark vision.  They love flying and take to the skies 
whenever they can.  They are inbred with the abilities of attack and
combat magics and can also learn to master healing arts.  Silver 
dragons are unaffected by cold and because of their high intelligence, 
are nearly impossible to charm.

-1 DRIDER~
{x
Driders are magical creatures, a cross between drow and spider. They
are relatively big creatures but very quick.  Due to their magical
nature, and they way they are created, driders receive attack and
detection magic.  Due to their number of legs, driders move with 
inhuman speed, and are always affected by haste.  Because of their 
close relation to spiders, driders are unaffected by poison.  They 
are also resistant to magic and negative - as they were created by 
evil magic.  Because they are evil creatures they can be greatly 
harmed by holy might and they retain their drow vulnerability to 
iron and light.  Casting professions receive attack and detection
magics for free.

Cyclops are huge, human like beings, with the exception of having
only one eye, in the center of their head.  Due to this deformity,
cyclops are constantly berserked, fighting anyone who dares to
even come close to insulting them.  Like their relatives, the giant
cyclops are barely marked by fire or cold, however, cyclops are
not very intelligent, and even the slightest mind magic can do
great harm to a cyclops.  Due to their size, and mighty strength,
cyclops receive stun, kick and bash for free.

Kenders are small demihumans.  They are lean creatures of the forest,

agile and are known to use hoopaks as their choice of weapon.  Due to 
the kenders' quickness, they are constantly affected by haste.  Kender
however, are not the smartest of creatures, and are therefore 
vulnerable to mental magic.  They make perfect thieves as they get
sneak, peek, steal and pick lock for free.

Gryphons are huge, flying creatures, that look much like a gigantic eagle.  
They are magical creatures, wondrous to behold.  Gryphons have excellent 
eyesight, allowing them to see incredibly well in any light or dark 
condition.  Due to the excellent nature of their eyesight, they are 
born with the gift of detection magics.  Due to their large size, gryphons 
are fairly strong, and because they are experts in using their claws, 
gryphons can gouge eyes out rather easily.  They are excellent flyers and 
so take to the skies whenever possible.  Due to their magical nature, 
gryphons are resistant to magic, however due to the fragility of their 
wings, gryphons can't stand cold or acid, and are easily drowned.

Gryfalcons are akin to gryphons, except for a strong resemblence to falcons, 
instead of eagles.  Like the gryphons, gryfalcons can see exceptionally well 
in the dark or in the light, can detect magical auras and are always 
affected by fly.  Gryfalcons however, are a bit hardier and resist disease 
and poison very well plus they are also very difficult to charm.  However,
due to their fragility, they greatly dislike acid and cold.  Gryfalcons are 
exceptionally skilled with their claws and gouge easily.  They can also 
detect anything hidden.

Felines are a most attractive race.  They are akin to cats with the 
difference that they walk on their hind legs like humans.  They are 
warm blooded and extremely fastidious by nature.  Like cats, they have
exceedingly good eyesight and can detect hidden and invisible creatures
from a long distance away.  They have both infrared and dark vision to
boot.  They are born with the abilities to avoid blows and to parry them
without thinking about it.  Not only are they immune to poison but they
resist the cold due to their thick fur.  They also see right through the
trickeries of wouldbe charmers and charlatans.  However, they are 
vulnerable to fire.  Being an extremely dextrous race, they get second
and third attack skills for free as well as meditation.

-1 PHOENIX~

Born of flames, the phoenix race is one of the most powerful known to
the realm.  One born of the phoenix can expect to reign majestically
over all the other races.  The Redemption spreads its wings far and wide 
and has keen eyesight, both near and far, detecting all in its path 
and wake.  The phoenix heals doubly fast and automatically defends 
itself by avoiding as much damage as possible and parrying the rest.  
It is immune to both fire and the trickeries of charm yet vulnerable 
to all things cold and holy.  Because the bird of fire shimmers in 
and out of view, it is resistant to both disease and poison.  This 
awe-inspiring race automatically benefits from fast healing, 
meditation and curative powers.

-1 TIEGRE~
{x
This bipedal race is distantly related to the tiger.  Grown accustomed
to walking on their hind legs, they have adapted to this form of
perambulation and it has been a turning point in their race history.
Given that they have an atuned eyesight which can detect hidden 
creatures, they also have infrared sight and their cuts and wounds
heal twice as fast as normal.  On an offensive level, they are 
extremely dextrous on their paws and benefit from permanent haste.
They dodge automatically from blows, parry all blows they couldn't 
dodge, have the ability to crush with their powerful legs and bash
with their strong limbs and can disarm without any hesitation.  This
race is immune to charm and resistant to poison, disease and light.
They get a second attack, not to mention sneak and hide for free.

-1 DEMON~
{x
Demons are the denizens of hell.  They vary greatly in size, and shape, 
however, they are generally about the size of an average human.  Not much is 
known about demons, as very few people who have come in contact with one have 
survived to tell the tale.  What has come into general knowledge however is 
that demons are highly proficient in backstabbing and combat magics.  They 
are relatively strong and very intelligent.  Demons are also very agile and 
tend to stay incredibly healthy through their long lives.  Demons can see 
very well in the night and are constantly able to pass through solid objects.  
Because demons are magical creatures, they resist magic.  Since they are also 
incredibly evil, they are resistant to negative magic.  However, the light of 
day can hurt them greatly and any holy item would do a demon great harm.

Valkyries are the angels of the land.  Descended from Heaven, valkyries are 
the embodiment of good.  Valkyries have beautiful, white feather wings and 
are always flying.  Because the air is on their cuts, they always heal
incredibly fast.  Valkyries are inherently good beings and seek to do good 
always.  They can cure any ailment, heal a person of any damage and protect 
a person from taking more damage.  These angelic creatures are resistant to 
charm and holy weapons do very little to them, since they themselves are 
holy, just as light does them little harm, as Heaven is the brightest of 
places.  However, Valkyries take great harm from magic and can't stand 
anything that is evil, thus they take a lot of damage from negative attacks.

Wraiths are magical, undead creatures.  When seen, a wraith seems 
insubstantial, much like a wisp of smoke.  Because of this enchantment, 
wraiths can easily pass through any solid object and due to this,  
wraiths can steal from almost anyone.  However, this race have learned
that being able to see everything is an important skill and have 
therefore taught themselves detection magic.  Wraiths, while not being 
very strong, are highly intelligent and dextrous creatures.  And because 
they are intangible, they are constantly floating above the ground.   
Wraiths also take very little damage from weapons and are completely 
unaffected by cold or acid.  However, wraiths are malicious creatures 
and therefore take great damage from holy attacks.  Light can do them 
great harm, as well as can magic.

Stun works through bash.  Every time a warrior, with stun, bashes, he has a 1 in 5 chance of
stunning the victim.  Every successful stun has a 1 in 5 chance of lasting two round, otherwise
it will last two round.  A stunned player or mob can not parry, dodge or shield block, get any of

-1 STRIDER 'STRIDER BASICS' 'STRIDER DEFAULT'~
Striders are the 2nd tier version of Rangers, masters of the hunt.
They have a blend of Gladiator and Sage skills with the ability to
Ambush.  Since they aren't as adept as warriors when it comes to
fighting and Sages when it comes to using magic, the skills and spells
tend to be expensive.  Striders naturally receive the ability to use a
dagger and also get second attack for nothing.  At level 50 or so they
receive the ability to levitate shields, freeing both hands for
weapons.  

Strider default includes:

weapons master - the art of combat with all weapons
parry - the art of avoiding blows  
envenom - the ability to poison a weapon or another item
kick - a non-magical extra attack
third attack - the ability to get 3 hits in one round
enhanced damage - multiplies damage in battle
hand to hand - the ability to fight without a weapon
Beguiling - mental attack spells
curative - the ability to cure diseases, blindness and poison
healing - spells that replenish health and movement
protective - protective spells coupled with spells that dispel the
{x  magic on others 
transportation - the ability to freely move objects, others, and yourself from place to place
~

-1 ROOMS~
Clan Room may be bought using cubics, see 'help prices' for a list of
the prices.  Only one clan room within an organization may be set as
a healing room. The price quoted for the mana/heal option will set BOTH
up to 200%, which is the max.  A clan may only have 1 healer, 1 guard
and 1 storekeeper.

Healers are the same THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE GAME, so DO NOT ask that
your healers prices be lowered!

Only clan leaders may make a request for additional rooms/eq/etc...
What we need from you when you request a clan item:
    Mobiles:
            Job of the Mobile (healer/store etc.)
            Name of the mobile
            Description of the mobile
    Equipment:
            Name of the original piece of equipment
            New name for the eq
            New description for the eq
    Rooms:
            Name of room
            A full description of the room

You have the option of selecting the (approximate) location for the
entrance to your clan rooms.  The entrance cannot be within the immediate
Midgaard area, nor too close to another clans entrance.  A backdoor (a
one-way portal) is placed in your original clan room, this leads to
somewhere in Midgaard chosen by us at random (you have no say in where
this comes out).

Clans with a large number of rooms will be given consideration for having
more than one entrance to their area in different areas of the realms.

When making room descriptions, do not add your or any other player's names 
to it. (The only names that are allowed to appear in a room description are 
those of the Founders, or perhaps legendary players that are not here anymore 
that somehow distinguished themselves).

When making clan items, do not ask the IMMs to copy items from other areas 
and make them appear in your clan. If you wan an original item, CREATE it. 
Copying from another area is simply stealing from it, not to mention helping
to make the mud crash.
~

-1 WANDS STAVES SCROLLS~
Magical items require training to use properly.  If your character lacks the
necessary skill to use an item, he will fail, possibly destroying it.  The
item skills are as follows:

scrolls		The reading of magical scrolls and books (see 'help recite')
staves		The use of staves and similar devices (see 'help brandish')
wands		The use of wands and similar items (see 'help zap')

-1 'GROUPS' 'INFO' 'PREMISE'~
The ROT skill system allows you to fully customize your new character, making
him or her skilled in the skills you choose.  New skills can be gained at a
later date with your guildmaster.  Skills are paid for with creation points, 
and the more creation points you have, the harder it is to gain a level.  
Furthermore, higher-cost skills are harder to practice.

Skill groups are like package deals for characters -- sets of skills or spells
that are closely related, and hence can be learned as a unit.  There is a 
default skill group for each class, which can be selected for a balanced 
selection of skills at a somewhat reduced cost.

The experience breakdown is as follows: (for a human)
points   exp/level     points   exp/level
40        1000         90        6000

scrolls		reading of scrolls and other magical volumes
staves		use of magical staves
wands		use of magical wands

for class defaults, check the classes themselves.
~

-1 MAGE 'MAGIC-USER' 'MAGE BASICS' 'MAGE DEFAULT'~
Mages specialize in the casting of spells, offensive ones in particular.
Mages have the highest-powered magic of any class, and are the only classes
able to use the draconian and enchanting spell groups.  They are also very
skilled at the use of magical items, though their combat skills are the 
weakest of any class.

All mages have the power to levitate a shield in front of them, freeing
both hands for weapons.

All mages begin with skill in the dagger. Any other weapon skills must be
purchased, at a very high rate.  The default skill selection for mages is
as follows:

maladictions	a selection of curses fit for any witch
protective	defensive magics, ranging from armor to stone skin
transporation	spells for getting from here to there
weather		spells for conjuring and mastering the elements
~

-1 CLERIC 'CLERIC BASICS' 'CLERIC DEFAULT'~
Clerics are the most defensively orientated of all the classes.  Most of their
spells focus on healing or defending the faithful, with their few combat spells
being far less powerful than those of mages. However, clerics are the best 
class by far at healing magics, and they posess an impressive area of
protective magics, as well as fair combat prowess.

Clerics recieve the power to levitate a shield in front of them once they
reach level 50, freeing both hands for weapons.

All clerics begin with skill in the mace.  Other weapon or shield skills must
be purchased, many at a very dear cost.  The default skill selection for 
clerics is as follows:

skills:
flail		the proper use of flails

spell groups:
attack		a selection of offensive magics
creation	the making of physical objects, such as food and water

maladictions	an assortment of curses
protective	defensive magics, including the powerful sanctuary spell
transportation	spells for getting from here to there
weather         spells for conjuring and mastering the elements
~

-1 THIEF 'THIEF BASICS' 'THIEF DEFAULT'~
Thieves are a marginal class. They do few things better than any other class,
but have the widest range of skills available.  Thieves are specialists at
thievery and covert actions, being capable of entering areas undetected where
more powerful adventurers would fear to tread.  They are better fighters than
clerics, but lack the wide weapon selection of warriors.

All thieves begin with the dagger combat skill, and are learned in steal as 
well.  Any other weapon skills must be purchased, unless the default selection
is chosen.  This default skill package includes:

skills:
mace		the use of maces and other blunt weapons
sword		swordplay and fencing
backstab	the art of hitting your opponent by surprise
disarm		used to deprive your opponent of his weapon
dodge		the best way to take a punch is not to be there
second attack	with training, the skilled thief can hit twice as fast
sharpen         the art of honing your weapon sharper for more damage
trip		a good way to introduce an opponent to the floor
hide		the art of remaining undetected in a room
peek		used to look into a person's belongings
pick lock	a useful skill for breaking and entering
sneak		with this skill, a thief can walk into a room undetected
~

-1 WARRIOR 'WARRIOR BASICS' 'WARRIOR DEFAULT'~
Warriors live for combat and the thrill of battle. They are the best fighters
of all the classes, but lack the subtle skills of thieves and the magical
talents of mages and priests.  Warriors are best for those who don't mind
taking the direct approach, even when another method might be called for.

Warriors begin with skill in the sword, and gain a second attack in combat.
Other weapon skills may be purchased cheaply, or gained in the default skill
package, which includes the following:

skills:
weaponsmaster	this group provides knowledge of all weapon types
shield block	the art of parrying with a shield
bash		a forceful rush with the body, designed to flatten your foes
enhanced damage	this skill multiplies your damage in battle
parry		the art of parrying with weapons
rescue		allows you to take the blows aimed for a companion
sharpen         allows you to hone your weapon for more damage
third attack	allows the skilled warrior to land three blows in one round
~

-1 RANGER 'RANGER BASICS' 'RANGER DEFAULT'~
Rangers are travelling warrior-druids, usually solitary and aloof.  They
are often the protectors of those far from home, travellers who are lost,
or even bounty hunters who track criminals in order to bring them to
justice or just to make a buck.  They are sometimes used as scouts for
armies, and sometimes make up their own force in times of war.

Rangers don't have the pure combat effectiveness of warriors, and lack
the total control of druidic magic that druids possess, but the combination
of those disciplines makes them a class to be reckoned with.

skills:
backstab        the art of hitting your opponent by surprise
enhanced damage this skill multiplies your damage in battle
parry           the art of parrying with weapons
sharpen         the art of honing you weapons
shield block    the art of parrying with a shield
weaponsmaster   this group provides knowledge of all weapon types

spell groups:
curative        spells that cure the sick and feeble of their ailments
healing         spells for treating wounds, from scratches to death blows
transportation  spells for getting from here to there
weather         spells for conjuring and mastering the elements
~

-1 DRUID 'DRUID BASICS' 'DRUID DEFAULT'~
Druids are the protectors of nature.  Some spend their lives in forests,
others in deserts, and some still in seas or mountainous regions.  Where
a druid can be closer to nature and life than to the constructs of mortals,
that druid can be happy.

They control a very powerful blend of magic, potent healing spells with
devastating combat spells, but they don't have transportation spells, as
druids are not wont to travel.  They aren't always well suited for it.

skills:
lore            the lore of magical items
second attack   with training, the skilled druid can hit twice as fast
sharpen         the art of honing weapons sharpen for more damage
shield block    the art of parrying with a shield
sneak           with this skill, a druid can walk into a room undetected

spell groups:
attack          a selection of offensive magics
benedictions    powerful magics that grant the blessings of the gods
creation        the making of physical objects, such as food and water
curative        spells that cure the sick and feeble of their ailments
healing         spells for treating wounds, from scratches to death blows
protective      defensive magics, including the powerful sanctuary spell
weather         spells for conjuring and mastering the elements
~

-1 VAMPIRE 'VAMPIRE BASICS' 'VAMPIRE DEFAULT'~
Vampires are killers.  They aren't truly alive in the sense that most
mortals are, but are rather undead, not really subject to whithering of
old age or the fading of the mind that those who are truly alive find
themselves subject to.  As a result vampires are long lived, and almost
all of them eventually go insane.  They are very much like thieves, but
possess very potent powers of magic.

Vampires are not really a class in the traditional since, as many don't
choose to be what they are, and their powers are not the result of education
and training, but of undead nature.

skills:
backstab        the art of hitting your opponent by surprise
disarm          used to deprive your opponent of his weapon
dodge           the best way to take a punch is not to be there
shield block    the art of parrying with a shield
sneak           with this skill, a vampire can walk into a room undetected

spell groups:
beguiling       spells that control the mind
detection       informational magics, such as detect magic and identify
enhancement     spells that maximize physical potential, such as haste

-1 WIZARD 'WIZARD BASICS' 'WIZARD DEFAULT'~
..{&Wizards are the 2nd tier version of Mages, the masters of offensive,
illusion and enchantment magics.  Due to their bookish nature, Wizards

prefer to use their wit to win a battle. Wizards naturally get the
ability to levitate shields.

~

-1 PRIEST 'PRIEST BASICS' 'PRIEST DEFAULT'~
..{%Priests are the 2nd tier version of Clerics, the masters of protective
and healing spells.  Priests are often coveted by groups for their
ability to heal others and themselves.  Priests are also fair in the
ways of fighting with weapons.  They can be impressive with attack
spells, but still don't match the ability of a Wizard.  Priests at
level 40 can levitate shields.

..{& Mercenaries are the 2nd tier version of thieves, the most deceptive
class in Thera.  They fighting abilities comperable to Gladiatiors,

~

-1 GLADIATOR 'GLADIATOR BASICS' 'GLADIATOR DEFAULT'~
..{&Gladiator is the 2nd tier version of a Warrior, the most straight
forward and brutal of the classes.

Though Gladiators can use magic, the spell classes are very expensive
and spells take a lot of practices to learn.  Not to mention the mana
of a Gladiator is minimal.

A Gladiator's default weapon is a sword and other weapon skills are
easily obtained.  Gladiators also get bash, 2nd attack, scrolls,
staves and wands.

~

-1 STRIDER 'STRIDER BASICS' 'STRIDER DEFAULT'~
..{&Striders are the 2nd tier version of Rangers, masters of the hunt.
They have a blend of Gladiator and Sage skills with the ability to
ambush.  Since they aren't as adept as warriors when it comes to
fighting and Sages when it comes to using magic, the skills and spells
tend to be expensive.  Striders naturally receive the ability to use a
dagger and also get second attack for nothing.  At level 50 or so they
receive the ability to levitate shields, freeing both hands for
weapons.

Strider default includes:

weapons master - the art of combat with all weapons

-1 SAGE 'SAGE BASICS' 'SAGE DEFAULT'~
..{&Sages are the 2nd tier version of Druids, masters of the elements.
They have a good mix of healing, protective and attack spells, but
aren't quite as adept as Priests and Wizards at their respective
trades.  Sages are however better suited for combat than their fellow
magic users.

Sages naturally recieve wands, scrolls and staves along with their
default weapon, polearm.  Other weapon skills are obtained at a very
reasonable cost.

Sage default inclues:
attack - offensive spells
benedictions - employing the help of a deity to aid you

..{&Liches are the 2nd tier answer to the vampire class, the undead
masters of mind control.  Liches hold the ability to drink blood to
revive themselves, thus not needing any kind of heal spells.  Vampires
are killers, though not as adept at sneaking as thieves, they are more
magical in nature and get spell classes relatively cheaply.

Liches naturally have the ability to use daggers, sneak and hide.

-1 EXOTIC WEAPONS WEAPON WEAPONSMASTER AXE DAGGER FLAIL MACE POLEARM SPEAR SWORD WHIP~
Each weapon skill applies to a specific group of armaments, and determines how
well a character fights with a particular weapon.  The weaponsmaster group
provides talent in all weapons (save exotics), from chair legs to halberds.
If the character has the parry skill as well, he can parry incoming attacks.
The chance of parrying is best if the character in question is skilled at 
both his weapon and his opponent's.

The weapon skills consist of the following:

weaponsmaster	skill group of all weapons listed below (save exotic weaponry)
axe		the use of axes, ranging from hand to great (but not halberds)
dagger		the use of knives and daggers, and other stabbing weapons
flail		skill in ball-and-chain type weapons
mace		this skill includes clubs and hammers as well as maces
polearm		the use of pole weapons (except spears), including halberds
spear		this skill covers both spears and staves, but not polearms
sword		the warrior's standby, from rapier to claymore
whip		the use of whips, chains, and bullwhips
exotic		the use of strange magical weapons (no skill group for this)

The exotic skill cannot be purchased, and is dependent solely upon level.
~

-1 TRANSPORT~
Syntax: cast transport <object> <char>

This spell will transport an obj from your inventory to the inventory of
another player.  You can turn off the ability to receive transports using
the notran command.
~

-1 'SHIELD BLOCK'~
Shield block is a rather fancy name for the art of parrying with a shield.
Characters with no shield block skill will not be able to defend themselves
well with a shield.  All classes may learn shield block, but only warriors and
clerics are good at it.  Beware, flails ignore shield blocking attempts, and
whips have an easier time getting around them.  Axes may split shields in two.
~

-1 ATTACK~
The attack spells are essentially powerful curses, fueled by divine energy
rather than magical power (like the combat spells are). They are less powerful
than the combat spells, but can still deal out a stinging blow.  Mages and 
thieves cannot use this group.  The attack spell group consists of the 
following spells:

demonfire	a powerful, but very evil, spell
dispel evil	torments evil foes
dispel good	calls down unholy power on good creatures
earthquake	brings the power of earth to bear against your foes
flamestrike	sends a column of flame from the heavens
heat metal	heats metal equipment to searing temperatures

the following: (different classes get certain spells only)

caster to resurrect the corpse of a fallen foe, turning it into a 
mindless slave.
~

-1 BENEDICTIONS~

They are often restricted to those of like alignment.  Only spell casters 
can use these spells.  The benedictions spell group consists of the
following:

bless		bestows divine favor upon the target
calm		if successful, stops all fighting in the room
frenzy		puts the recipient into beserker rage
holy word	aids your allies while calling divine wrath upon your foes
remove curse	removes malevolent magic from players and items
~

-1 COMBAT~
These sorcerous spells are, in the words of one famous mage, just 'more ways to
toss energy around'.  They are the most powerful of the damaging spells, and
considered an essential part of most wizards' collections. Spell casters only 
have access to these spells.  In order of power, the combat spell group
contains the following magics:

magic missile	send a weak energy bolt into a foe
chill touch	weakens your enemy with a frigid grasp
burning hands	sends a blast of fire into your foe

befall an adventurer.   For healing of damage, see the healing spell group.
Curative spells are used by mages, clerics, rangers and druids.

cure blindness	restored sight to the blind
cure disease	heals the plague
cure poison	removes the harmful effects of poison
~

-1 DETECTION~
The detection spells have may uses, all related to gathering information. They
can be used to see hidden objects, give information about treasure, or even
scry out the true nature of your foe.  All classes except warriors and thieves

~

-1 DRACONIAN~
The Draconian spell group deals with the magic of dragons -- in this case, 
bringing forth the devastating power of their breath weapons upon your foes.
Only mages have the mental training necessary to cast these spells, and few
of them ever reach the level of mastery required to use them.

acid breath	 uses the black dragon's attack upon an enemy
fire breath	 calls forth the flames of a red dragon
frost breath	 drains the life from a foe with the power a white dragon
gas breath	 suffocates your enemies with poison gas

enchant armor	increases the protective value of armor
fireproof       shields items from the harmful effects of fire and acid
recharge	restores power to a depleted wand or staff
~

-1 ENHANCEMENT~

superhuman strength and speed.  However, these spells may often have harmful
effects upon the recipient.

giant strength	grants increased strength
haste		doubles the speed of the target, but slows down healing
infravision	allows monsters to be seen in the dark
refresh		restores energy to tired adventurers
~


-1 HARMFUL~
This spell group is the opposite of healing.  The harmful spells are designed
to tear flesh from bone, rupture arteries, and generally turn the body against
itself.  Only spell casters may use this spell group.
In order of power, the harmful spells are:

cause light	inflicts minor wounds on an enemy
cause serious	inflicts wounds on a foe
cause critical  causes major damage to the target
harm		the most deadly harmful spell
~

-1 HEALING~
The healing spells are used to cure the wounds that adventurers inevitably
suffer in battle.  For curing other conditions, such as poison, see the
curative spell group.  Only spell casters have access to this group.
In order of power, the healing spells are:

cure light	heals minor wounds
refresh		restores vigor to a tired adventurer
cure serious	heals wounds
cure critical	closes all but the worst wounds
heal		the most powerful healing spell
mass healing	casts a heal spell on each player in the room
~

-1 ILLUSION~
The illusions spells are dedicated to deception and trickery.  They can be
used to mask appearances, or create distractions for the party.  
Only spell casters can cast illusion spells, which consist of the 
following:

invis		turns the target invisible
mass invis	turns the caster's group invisible
ventriloquate	allows the caster to put words in someone's mouth
dispel invis	dispels the invisibility on someone or something
prismatic spray an area-attack which launches beam attacks of many effects
~

-1 MALADICTIONS~
Maladictions are a group of curses and other baneful spells, designed to
cripple, inconvenience, or torture, rather than kill outright.  These spells
may be cast by most spell casters.

blindess	strikes the target blind
curse		prevents recalling and weakens the target in combat
energy drain	drains experience and mana, while strengthening the caster
plague		causes the target to suffer a slow, painful death from plague
poison		weaker than plague, but often fatal

physical attack.  They range from the weak armor spell to the sought-after
sanctuary charm.  Also included in this group are several spells for dispeling
hostile magics. Most spell casters may use this group, which consists of the

~

-1 SHIELDING FIRESHIELD ICESHIELD SHOCKSHIELD HOLYSHIELD UNHOLYSHIELD~
These arcane and costly spells are only for the most learned of the ranks of
mages, clerics and druids wandering the land.  They require great amounts of 
energy and can be very devastating. They can only be cast on the caster.  The 
following spells are included in this group and are listed in order of strength:

        iceshield       surrounds caster with a thick shell of ice
        fireshield      surrounds caster with a flaming inferno

and are released under the GNU license.(use them, edit them, give me mention)
Questions and comments can be sent to micah@cse.unl.edu.
~

-1 TRANSPORTATION~
The transportation group is used for travel, whether by flight, magical
teleportation, or walking through walls.  All classes except warriors may 
learn some or all of these spells, which are among the most useful in the game.

fly		allows the target to fly over nearly all obstacles
gate		transports the caster to the target
nexus		forms a two-way portal to a far off destination
pass door	allows the caster to walk through walls
portal		creates a one-way portal to a destination
summon		transports the target to the caster
teleport	sends the target to a random location
transport	sends the target object to another player
shadow walk     the ability to walk the shadow plane (thieves & mercs)
~

-1 WEATHER~
These spells allow the caster to manipulate local weather conditions, as well
as summon fog clouds, lightning, or even electrical glows.  This group is
usable by all spell casters, but druids & sages gain the most benefit:

call lightning	  summons a huge bolt from the heavens, if the weather is right
faerie fire	  surrounds the target in a glowing aura (harming their AC)
faerie fog	  reveals all hidden creatures in the room
lightning bolt	  sends a bolt of electricity into the target
sleet		  sends a powerful force of rain & snow to damage the target
acid rain	  a heaven sent downpour of acid rain strikes the target
meteorswarm	  an extremely powerful two-fold area attack of meteors

air elemental     a summoned creature of the air element to aid the caster
megafaerie fire   surrounds the target in a damaging aura (more so than regular)
fire elemental    a summoned creature of the fire element to aid the caster

(the weather command, unrelated to this group, shows local weather conditions)
~

-1 BACKSTAB~
Backstab is the favored attack of thieves, murderers and other rogues.  It 
can be used with any weapon type, but is most effective with piercing weapons.
The damage inflicted by a backstab is determined by the attacker's level, his
weapon skill, his backstab skill, and the power of his opponent.
Only thieves and vampires may learn the backstab.  (See ambush for rangers)
~

-1 BASH~
The bash skill is a warrior talent, a brute-force attack designed to knock
your foe to his knees.  Its success depends on many factors, including the
bash rating, your weight, and the size of your opponent.  Bashing a dragon
is not generally a wise idea.
~

-1 BERSERK~
Only powerful warriors can master berserking, the ability to enter insane rage
in combat.  Its effects are not altogether unlike the frenzy spell -- a huge
surge of combat prowess, coupled with a disregard for personal safety.  
Berserking warriors are more resistant to the effects of magic.
~

-1 DIRT 'DIRT KICKING'~
Consider by some to be a cowardly skill, dirt kicking gives the clever 
combatant a chance to blind his opponent by casting dirt into his eyes.  The
blindness does not last long, but can provide an edge in combat.  Dexterity
helps in hitting or avoiding a dirt kick.  
~

-1 DISARM~
Disarm is a somewhat showy and unreliable skill, designed to relieve your
opponent of his weapon.  The best possible chance of disarming occurs when you
are skilled both your own and your opponent's weapon. 
~

-1 DODGE~
In the words of one wise warrior, 'the best way to block a blow is to not
be where it lands'.  The dodge skill honors this tradition, by improving the
character's natural agility to the point where many blows will miss the 
target. The chance of dodging is also affected by the dexterity of the
attacker and the target.
~

-1 'ENHANCED DAMAGE'~
Most classes can become skilled enough in combat that they are
able to inflict more damage than other classes.  Enhanced damage is checked
for with each hit, although with a low skill, the chance of receiving a bonus
is very low indeed.
~

-1 ENVENOM~
The envenom skill is a cowardly skill designed to win a battle through 
alchemy and treachery rather than skill or strength.
Or, put another way, it's a skill used by the smart to kill the foolish.
Food, drink, and weapons may be envenomed, with varying effects. Poisoned
food or drink puts a mild poison spell on the consumer, and is unlikely to
be more than a minor inconvience (after all, the typical adventurer could
drink sewer water with only a trace of the runs).  A poisoned weapon, on
the other hand, can inflict serious damage on an opponent as the poison 
burns through his bloodstream.  But be careful, blade venom evaporates 
quickly and is rendered almost powerless by repeated blows in combat.
~

-1 'HAND TO HAND'~
Hand to hand combat is a rare skill in the lands of Midgaard.  Learning this
style of fighting gives the player a weapon even when disarmed -- bare hands.
Trained hand to hand experts are far more effective than many swordsmen.
~

-1 KICK~
Kicking allows the adventurer to receive an extra attack in combat, a powerful
kick. However, a failed kick may throw an unwary fighter off balance.  Fighters
and clerics are the most skilled at kicking, although thieves may also learn
it.
~

-1 PARRY~
If at first you fail to dodge, block it.  Parry is useful for deflecting 
attacks, and is succesful more often than dodge.  Parry requires a weapon for
full success, the hand-to-hand skill may also be used, but results in reduced
damage instead of no damage.  The best chance of parrying occurs when the
defender is skilled in both his and his opponent's weapon type.
~

-1 RESCUE~
A friend in need is a friend indeed.  And when in combat, a warrior with
the rescue skill is just the friend you need.  Rescue allows you to intercede
in combat, protecting weaker characters from bodily harm. Hopefully the
favor will be returned.  Success in rescuing depends on the skill rating, as
well as a comparision of level, dexterity, and speed between the character and
the target. (note: you rescue a friend, not the monster)
~

-1 TRIP~
Back by popular demand.  Trip is a somewhat dastardly attack, and involves
using any one of a number of methods to bring your opponent down to the ground.
Tripping large monsters is generally not a good idea, and agile ones will
find the attack easy to avoid.
~

-1 'SECOND ATTACK'~
Training in second attack allows the character a chance at additional strikes
in combat -- allow a 100% second attack does NOT guarantee 2 attacks every
round.  Any class may learn this skill.
~

-1 'THIRD ATTACK'~
Training in third attack allows the character a chance at an additional strike
in a combat, and increases the chance of a second attack as well.  Perfect
third attack does NOT assure three attacks per round.
~

-1 'FOURTH ATTACK'~
Training in fourth attack allows the character a chance at an additional strike
in a combat, and increases the chance of a third attack as well.  Perfect
fourth attack does NOT assure four attacks per round.
~

-1 'FIFTH ATTACK'~
Training in fifth attack allows the character a chance at an additional strike
in a combat, and increases the chance of a fourth attack as well.  Perfect
fifth attack does NOT assure five attacks per round.
~

-1 HIDE SNEAK~
Hide and sneak are similar skills, both related to remaining undetected.
Hide has a very high chance of success, but only works for as long as the
character remains stationary.  Sneak may be used when moving (including to
sneak by monsters), but has a lower chance of success.
~

-1 'FAST HEALING'~
The fast healing skill improves wound healing rates, whether walking, resting,
or sleeping. It represents knowledge of healing herbs or just general 
toughness and stamina.  Fast healing is checked every tick, and it is 
possible for it to fail.
~

-1 LORE~
Lore is a general skill, consisting of knowledge of myths and legends. Use
of the lore skill gives a chance of obtaining information on an object,
concerning its power and uses.  It also may occasionally increase the value
of an object, because more will be known about its worth.
~

-1 HAGGLE HAGGLING~
Haggling is an indispensable skill to the trader.  It allows a character to
match wits with a merchant, seeking to get a better price for merchandise,
or to buy at the lowest possible cost.  Unfortunately, most merchants are 
already very skilled at haggling, so the untrained adventurer had best 
guard his treasure closely.  Thieves are natural masters at haggling, 
although other classes may learn it as well.
~

-1 PEEK~
The peek skill is useful for seeing what a player or monster is carrying,
the better to use the steal command with.  More intelligent characters are
harder to peek at.  All characters may learn peek, but thieves are the most
common practicioners.
~

-1 PICK 'PICK LOCK'~
Lock picking is one of the prime skills of thieves, allowing them to gain
access to many secured areas.  Lock picking chances are improved by  
intelligence, and hindered by the difficulty of the lock. Other classes may
learn to pick locks, but they will never find it easy.
~

-1 MEDITATION~
This skill is similar to fast healing, but relies on the concentration and
mantras to increase mana recovery when the character is sleeping or resting.
Thieves and warriors, with their troubled minds and violent attitudes, have
much trouble learning to meditate.
~

-1 STEAL~
Theft is the defining skill of the thief, and is only available to that class.
It allows items to be stolen from the inventory of monsters and characters.
~

-1 'DETECT GOOD'~
Syntax: cast 'detect good'
 
This spell enables the caster to detect good characters, which will
reveal a characteristic golden aura.
~

-1 'DISPEL GOOD'~
Syntax: cast 'dispel good' <victim>
 
This spell invokes the wrath of Alys on a good victim. It can be very
dangerous for casters who are pure of heart.
~

-1 'RECHARGE'~
Syntax: cast 'recharge' <item>

The recharge spell is used to restore energy to depleted wands and staves.
Fully exhausted items cannot be recharged, and the difficulty of the spell
is proportional to the number of charges used.  Magic items can only be
recharged one time successfully.
~

-1 'DEMONFIRE'~
Syntax: cast 'demonfire' <target>

Demonfire is a spell of blackest evil, and as such can only be used by those
who follow the paths of darkness.  It conjures forth demonic spirits to 
inflict terrible wounds on the enemies of the caster.
~

-1 'RAY OF TRUTH'~
Syntax: cast 'ray of truth' <target>

Ray of truth opens a portal to the planes of positive energy, bringing forth
a beam of light of sufficient purity to harm or or annihilate the servants
of evil.  It cannot harm the pure of heart, and will turn and strike 
casters who are tainted by evil.
~

-1 'PORTAL'~
Syntax: cast 'portal' <target>

The portal spell is similar to gate, but creates a lasting one-way portal
to the target creature, instead of transporting the caster.  Portals are
entered using 'enter' or 'go' command, as in 'go portal'.  Portals cannot
be made to certain destinations, nor used to escape from gate-proof rooms.
Portal requires a special source of power to be used, unfortunately the
secret of this material component has been lost...
~

-1 'NEXUS'~
Syntax: cast 'nexus' <target>

This spell is virtually identical to portal (see 'help portal'), with the
only difference being that while portal creates a one-way gate, a nexus 
spell makes a two-sided gate.  It also lasts longer than the lower-powered
portal spell.  Both spells require an additional power source, the secret
of which has been lost...
~

-1 'HEAT METAL'~
Syntax: cast 'heat metal' <target>

Heat metal is a powerful clerical attack spell, with effects that vary 
according to the armor of the victim.  It heats up the metal equipment
(assumed to be all weapons and armor at this point in time) on the target,
causing him or her to drop them if possible, taking serious burns in the
process (possibly fatal if the equipment is too heavy to remove easily).
This spell does no damage to creatures who are immune to fire.
~

-1 'HOLY WORD'~
Syntax: cast 'holy word'

Holy word involves the invocation of the full power of a cleric's god, with
powerful blessings on the priest's allies.  All creatures of like alignment in the
room are blessed and filled with righteous divine wrath.  The cleric suffers
greatly from the strain of this spell, being left unable to move and 
drained of vitality.  Experience loss is no longer associated with the spell.
~

-1 FRENZY~
Syntax: cast 'frenzy' <target>

The frenzy spell fills the target with righteous fury, greatly increasing
his or her attack skill and damaging capacity.  Unfortunately, this divine
wrath is coupled with a tendency to ignore threats to personal safety, 
making the character easier to hit.  Frenzy provides immunity to the calm
spell (see 'help calm'), and may only be used on those of the caster's 
alignment.
~

-1 CALM~
Syntax: cast 'calm' 

One of the most useful and often overlooked abilities of the master cleric is
the calm spell, which can put an end to all violence in a room.  Calmed
creatures will not attack of their own volition, and are at a disadvantage
in combat as long as the spell soothes their minds.  The more violence 
activity there is in a room, the harder the spell, and it is all or nothing --
either all combat in the room is ended (with the exception of those who
are immune to magic) or none is.
~

-1 HASTE~
Syntax: cast 'haste' <target>

The haste spell increases the speed and agility of the recipient, allowing
an extra attack (or even a backstab) in combat, and improving evasive
abilities in combat.  However, it produces a great strain on the system,
such that recuperative abilities are halved.  Haste is capable of negating
the slow spell. (see 'help slow').
~

-1 SLOW~
Syntax: cast 'slow' <target>

Despite popular mythology, slow is not the opposite of haste, but is a spell
with it's own unique set of effects.  When cast on an unfortunate victim,
it slows its movements, making it easier to hit and reducing its rate
of attack.  The effect of slow also double movement costs and halve healing
rates, due to reduced metabolism.
~

-1 PLAGUE~
Syntax: cast 'plague' <target>

The plague spell infests the target with a magical disease of great virulence,
sapping its strength and causing horrific suffering, possibly leading to
death.  It is a risky spell to use, as the contagion can spread like
wildfire if the victim makes it to a populated area.
~

-1 'CREATE ROSE'~
Syntax: cast 'create rose'

A romantic spell that creates a fragrant red rose, with utterly no game
use whatsoever.
~

-1 'PROTECTION GOOD' 'PROTECTION EVIL'~
Syntax: cast 'protection evil' <target>
	cast 'protection good' <target>

The protection spells reduce damage taken from attackers of the appropriate
ethos, and improve saving throws against all forms of magic. They may not
be cast on others, and one person cannot carry both defenses at the same
time.
~
0 'GIANT STRENGTH'~
Syntax: cast 'giant strength' <character>
 
This spell increases the strength of the target character.
~

-1 'CHAIN LIGHTNING'~
Syntax : cast 'chain lightning' <target>

Chain lightning is a deadly spell, producing a powerful bolt of lightning
that arcs from target to target in the room, until its force is fully
expended.  Allies of the caster may be hit by this spell if they are members 
of a clan, while the caster himself will not be struck unless no other
viable target remains.  Chain lightning is most effective when used on
groups of creatures.
~

-1 SCAN FARSIGHT~
scan farsight
Syntax: scan
	scan <direction>
	cast 'farsight'

The scan command allows the user to detect movement in surrounding areas.

The farsight spell expands the caster's consciousness, allowing him or her
to see far away beings like they were in the same room.  It takes intense
concentration, often leaving the caster helpless for several minutes.
The spell may be used for a general scan that reaches a short distance in
all directions, or with a directional component to see creatures much
farther away.
~

-1 MASS HEALING~
Syntax: cast 'mass healing' 

The mass healing spell, as its name might suggest, performs a healing spell
on all players in the room.  It also throws in a refresh spell for good
measure.
~

-1 'FLOATING DISC'~
Syntax: cast 'floating disc'

This useful spell creates a floating field of force which follows the caster
around, allowing him or her to pile treasure high with no fear of weight
penalties.  It lasts no more than twice the casters level in hours, and
usually less.  It can hold 10 pounds per level of the caster, with a 
maximum of five pounds per item.  The spell requires an open float location
on the character, and the only way to remove the disc is to die or allow it
to run out of energy.
~

-1 FIREPROOF~
Syntax: cast 'fireproof' <object>

The fireproof spell creates a short-lived protective aura around an object,
to protect it from the harmful effects of acid and flame.  Items protected
by this spell are not harmed by acid, fire, or the heat metal spell.
Although inexpensive to use, the spell's short duration makes it impractical
for protecting large numbers of objects.
~

-1 ALIAS UNALIAS~
Syntax: alias
	alias <word>
	alias <word> <substitution>
	unalias <word>

The alias command allows limited shortening of command names.  At this time,
aliases cannot call other aliases, and cannot generate more than one command.
Alias by itself lists your current aliases, Alias <word> lists the alias with 
that name (if such exist), and alias with both a word and and argument 
produces a new alias.  You cannot alias either alias or unalias to a new
command.  Examples of use:

alias gc get all corpse --> typing gc will equal typing 'get all corpse'
alias ff cast 'fireball' --> ff orc will equal 'cast 'fireball' orc'

Only the first word on the line will be subsituted at this time.
