Inside the Cemetary Atop the Hills~
Strange that a cemetary would normally look hideous and dark, but the
lush grass is cut almost perfectly as well-carved tombstones stand long to
the west and east neatly in a row.  Trees stand high and blossom healthy
branches and greeneries all about.  Several tall statues are here and there
honoring those passing who once contributed in Redemption in a heroic fashion. 
A stone paved road continues north while before you to the south, the
cemetary exits.

Here lies Zap the Archmage.  In his younger days, Zap amazed his family
and friends with his keen intellect.  Who would have know that he would
become one of the greatest mages ever to live in the Land of Redemption.  From
his days of battling mages on mountain tops, to slaying dragons with a
single word, to dethroning evil warlords, this mage was one to be trifled
with.  His unique mind, and overwhelming presence as a source of magic will
never be like any other that has, is, or will be to come.

Her gift was the ability to heal people, inside and out.  While growing up,
she discovered her gift by laying her hands on a wounded dove.  Since then,
she has touched the hearts and lives of many.  She at one point traveled
from town to town, healing all in need.  She has dedicated herself to the
needs of others.  Her name brings a smile to those who knew her, and a deep
sense of what love truly means in this world.  We will miss you Ezmirel.

did not go adventuring, but protected his village.  He was loved and
honored.  He sacrificed himself by taking a raiding drow escort which gave
the town time to evacuate.  This will never be forgotten for what you have
done.  May your soul rest in peace.

people knew him and fewer people saw him.  He killed for the money, he
killed for the pleasure and he killed for the fun.  He left his mark by
setting up many of the infamous thief and assassin rings around the world. 
But he did it, so that those who lived off the street, those who would not
see more than 10 gold pieces in their life, would have a better future.  May
you find the wealth you have been searching for.

R.I.P. Hagar~
Here lies Hagar the Warrior.  Born on the Northern Plains, Hagar was
destined to be a man of his tribe.  At a young age, he joined his tribe in
many raids on nearby villages, each time proving his strength and courage. 
By the age of 21, he became tribe leader and lead to much prosperity through
his brute strength.  He once took on three ogres with his bare hands, and
came forth victorious.  He went forth into the Great Icelands of the North,
and defeated the Ice Wyrm.  His accomplishments are endless, but in the end
what brought him into power, let him down, his strength.

Here lies Palshife.  He was a man where no place or woman could keep.  He
had a restlessness.  Some say he was cursed to roam the world.  Other says
he was given the quest to find the Holy Grail.  What we know is that where
ever he went, good deeds were to follow.  He showed compassion to the weak
and poor, yet was unmerciful towards the rich and greedy.  He gave his life
to doing the little things that made a difference.  May his sould find a
final resting place here.

R.I.P. Gynix~
Here lies Gynix.  He was a mysterious man.  He did not cut down dragons
with a single blow, he did not kill three wizards at one time, he didn't
even defend a village against raiding goblin hoards.  He was a great
teacher.  He did what was the best that he could, not fighting, not casting
spells, but teaching.  And through his teaching, he produced many great
warriors, knights, wizards, rangers, leaders, fathers and peace keepers.  He
started from the beginning and taught children to grow up to be men and
women of honor.  From his teaching have come many other teachers, and that
is what he has left on this world.  May you spirit rest from the works you
have done.

R.I.P. Korgath~
Here lies Korgath.  He was a good strong laddie.  One with courage rarely
seen.  He was like a ox, the strength pummeling through ranks of thieves,
thugs, and low lifes.  He was the champion for the people.  Whenever he had
the chance, he crushed evil with his tiny toe.  He was the symbol for what
each and every man, woman and child should be.  It was a sad day when he was
to become the King Of Redemption, but he was decapitated by an unhappy
mistress.  We still love you.  May your spirit enter each of us as we read
this.

A Steady Climb Deeper In the Cemetary~
The walk has steadily climbed towards a small hilly area as thick trees
appear distantly from you in a row like giant bushes.  The path continues
north where a row of strange stone graves are seen.

Never Will Be Forgotten Kira~

never known.  She did bring love to the hearts of those she touched.  Ever
since she was a wee bitty lass, she brought crowds to tears with her antics.
She will be remember most, by the way she touched each and every person. 
She was one to stand up in the darkness and shine the light of life which is
so rarely seen in this day and age.  As she has passed from this life to the
next, we know that her spirit remains with us today.

We'll Never Forget You Opio~
Born a child of goodness, never intended to hurt but to make peace with
one and with all.  Opio was a figure of truth.  He lived his entire life in
truth whether it was with bad intent or good..  He was real.  As a youth, he
encountered many hardships and many times of frustration with the loss of
his parents at a young age and countless numbers of tribulations with those
who lived to oppose and abuse his nature.  Never a violent individual but
someone that everyone sought as unique but rather strange, interesting but
predictable, true but even more..  Holy.  The world mourns for his inner
glow for now Redemption seems a bit dull without you Opio..  We love you and
will mourn you till we join you.

Before the 2nd Stone Podium~
A stone podium stands beside the road here for you to look at.  Rows of
thick white marble graves are seen from both sides as more of these unusual
tombstones arouse your curiousity.  Thick green trees stand high above here
as the way north suddenly is almost covered in darkness.  A tall statue is
barely seen to the north.  The PODIUM standing here arouses your curiousity
as you look over to READ it.

Korwyn, You Were A Champion~

soldier, warrior, and mercenary knew his name and feared it.  He was a just
ruler, a honest king, and a chivalrist man.  May the immortals bless him in

for each other.  Her life was too short, but her spirit lives on.
