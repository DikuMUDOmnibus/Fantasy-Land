{bGrady's Pub and Inn{}~
When you enter this room your nose is bombarded with the scent of aged
whiskey straight from the barrel.  A wooden bar runs the length of the far
wall, with inviting barstools in front.  {bGrady{} still makes a good living
off his pub and inn.  To the west lies the check-in desk for the inn
upstairs.

{bGrady's Pub and Inn{}~
The smell isn't quite as strong here.  While the Inn doesn't look new, it
does seem clean and inviting for a weary traveler.  A polished wooden
counter sits next to the foot of the stairs where the innkeeper can watch
all who come in and out.  On the walls hang long {cmirrors{} decorated in
{yfake gold gilding{}, freshly watered {g ferns{} hang from the ceiling and
drape down the sides of the counter.

for the night revealing a set of {Rpure silk sheets{}, underneath a soft
{rdown comforter{}.  Next to the bed sits a nightstand that has a beautiful
silver candlestick on it.  There is a mirror hanging from the ceiling over
the bed.  Plush carpets tickle your feet when you walk.  There is a door to
