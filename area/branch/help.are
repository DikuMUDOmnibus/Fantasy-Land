-1 STORY~
...{&
In the beginning of the realm, there came a light in the vast darkness of
the condition known as existence.  The one known as F'nor came and claimed
the lands around as his own.  He was kind, and the light he brought was
very appreciated by the masses of people that had been living in darkness
for so long.  F'nor, and his dragon Canth, were Gods in the eyes of those
around.  But there was one who remembered the darkness.  One who found the
light to be oppressing, and not as benevolent as those around.  Her heart
was as pitch, black and thick with hatred.  This one was Alys.
     Alys had seen how F'nor did his tricks and powers, and soon taught
herself to emulate those powers, although she could not match F'nor's power
in those skills.  She planned to overthrow F'nor and return the world to
the state of darkness it was before, the way she remembered and loved.
Unfortunately for Alys, the people of the realm as a whole did not
wish to return to those days as she did.  A very few agreed with Alys,
but most all sided with F'nor.  Alys grew very angry, and took to very
violent acts and subterfuge to spread her ideas about the absence of
light.  She slandered the light, and spread lies saying it was evil, but
the people saw through her attempts at deception, and grew to hate her 
even more.  Finally Alys just threw herself totally against F'nor,
thinking that with F'nor out of the way, she would be able to rule
completely, and the people would grow to love her just as much as they now
loved F'nor.
     F'nor loved the people he had brought out of the darkness, and he
could not bring himself to stand by and watch this Alys attack some of
these people just because they liked it better light.  F'nor decided that
even though he loved peace, this one must be pacified one way or the
other.  He tried to talk to this hater of light, but Alys just threw
hate back in his face, and even tried to bring about F'nor's death, which
Canth saved him from.  So F'nor, under advice from some of his closest new
friends, decided that he had to fight back.
     There came a time one fine bright day, when Alys just all out
attacked F'nor.  She did this in front of a multitude of people.  F'nor had
been advised to expect this by some who knew of Alys before F'nor's
arrival, so he was fully ready.  F'nor had learned of Alys's power and
made himself immune to that attack, and struck back at Alys with a
fierce power of his own.  Alys was caught totally unaware by the
ferocity of this attack by the normally peaceful F'nor.  F'nor totally
decimated Alys that day, and Alys, defeated soundly, retreated to
recover her wounds, and pride.
     F'nor knows that Alys was not beaten permanently, as she was always
too tenacious in her hatred, but for the time being, Alys has been
pacified.  There will most likely come a time when Alys feels prepared
enough to strike again, but until that time, the Light reigns supreme,
and F'nor is still most loved by the people of the realm.

-1 CRIMSON SOLDIERS~

In the times of the creation of Redemption, immortals roamed the worlds. In 
those days, wars were fought and gods perished. The orc immortal Amaranth 
had defeated many in his campaigns of war. In one such battle, Amaranth was 
cut and two drops of blood fell to the earth. From these two drops, two 
being formed. They were twins and were named Kingston and Helgriz. Seeing 
their father, they too wanted to wage war and were fiercely jealous of the 
powers of the immortals who have ruled Redemption. Kingston and Helgriz went 
underground and built an army for that Day, which they would emerge and 
faithfully shed the blood of the inhabitants of Redemption.
Our Day is now, and we shall see the rise of a new power and darkness in 
the realms of Redemption.
~
-1 BARDS~
A cowled person stops in front of you and appears to give you
a once over. Appearing to nod to itself, the person speaks in
a melodious voice, "So, interested in the Bards are we, and
well you should."

The person pauses for a moment then continues on, "Let me take
a brief second to dispel a misconception or two you might have.
We, Bards, are not minstrels and troubadours desiring to entertain
you or others with song or verse, though with song and verse
we may advise and/or teach. The desire to be somebody's gopher
never crosses our minds. Nor do personal vendettas have a place
outside of the arena or wars."

Looking pleased the person takes a sip from a decanter under its
cloak and continues its dialogue, "So, now that we have dealt with
the misconceptions let me tell you what the Bards are about and what
we do. We are a clan of chroniclers and collectors. What do we
collect? We collect knowledge, stories of past exploits, and tidings
of current events. Why do we collect and chronicle these things,
because if we do not who will. No one will remember the warriors of
old, the battles, the quests, the loves, the defeats, the failures,
the losses and doomed shall we be to repeat the past. To this end,
we have committed ourselves to learn, remember, advise, and teach this
knowledge to others. We do this by traveling the lands far and wide,
listening to every story, investigating the facts of an event, learning
from our peers within Bards, and from applying what we have learned and
give advice and guidance to our peers within and without the clan."

Taking a deep breath and with a sense of sadness in its voice, "But
this path is not for everyone. Who wishes to remember the past mistakes
or the faults of their friends and companions? Who is willing to be
truthful in all things no matter how small or large? Who wishes to
remain impartial when the heart wishes otherwise? If still undaunted
and desire to learn more please contact my associates, and express your
interest."

Turning away the person walks away waving briefly before disappearing 
from sight.
~
-1 FORSAKEN~
What defines an action as good or evil? It is normally
based on the mores and laws of society...and if that
society is evil or corrupt, what then? True combat has
been wasting away, while corruption strikes across the
realm. A guild devoted to balance and the greater
good, Forsaken openly opposes active evil. Formed of
people with their own unique skills and talents,
people work as a unified force, while following their
own passions. By contributing our own unique style of
socializing, management and fighting, everyone will
learn to trust and respect each other, as well as
honing their own style of combat.
~
-1 BLUE ROSE~
Magic, Wonder and Imagination have always been the allure to the Realms of
Redemption. Lately these virtues have fallen by the way, as seen by the current
demise of the Blue Rose. The Rose itself is reflection of the current state of
the Realms. When in the realms are in Chaos the Rose weakens and withers, when
peace and goodwill prevail the Rose prospers and grows.

Of late many have forsaken and overlooked the beauty and life abounding 
here, seeking instead a quick rise to fame and fortune, only to find themselves
frustrated and at odds with life itself.  This weakens the Rose and the well
being of the denizens of Redemption, causing many to continue their search beyond
its borders.

It is the purpose of the Clan of the Blue Rose to bring back and cultivate a
need for the wonder and beauty of the Realms to use magic and imagination to
make the journey in itself an end to the means. As the Keepers of the Rose, the
clan will become one with the land, one with its magic and beauty one with
Redemption. Many wonders abound, under every rock, behind every tree, behind every
door, round every corner. Stop, look and listen and live this magical life to
its fullest!
~
-1 MORGUE~
...
The Morgue is an area that your corpse goes to if you are under level 25
and you die. The {&Morgue{x is located south from the {RTemple of Stupid{x,
which is in Midgaard. Look around, you'll find it. Or you can type MOTD and 
the directions are there.  Once you attain level {!25{x your corpse will 
no longer go there and you will need to have a clan member or friend help 
you get the corpse, or you can get it yourself (don't forget to take a light).

0 WAR~

{rGLOBAL WAR{x
Available commands:
	{gwar join{x	- join the war
	{gwar quit{x	- quit the war 
	{giwar{x	- toggle the war information channel on and off
	{gwar brag{x	- brag about your victories
	{gwar score{x	- see the stats for the current war
	{gwar start{x	- starts a global war [immortal only]
	{gwar stop{x	- stops the global war [immortal only]
	{gwar tournament{x - starts a tournament [immortal only]

When a global war is started you can join the war by typing {rWAR JOIN{x. During the war 
most of the PK restrictions are removed. The pk-level limit is extended to 20 up and down. 
This means that cross-tiers, non-pk clan members, non-clanned people, and people of same 
clans can fight each other within the war level limits.  

When you die you and your corpse are transported to the war body collection center. Fighting 
in the war body collection center is not allowed. You should stay there until you are fully 
recuperated before you rejoin the war.  

For all of those worried about your things, dying does not affect rot_death eq, PK records, 
your corpse is safe from looting and there will be no voodoos or zombies of you terrorizing 
the public. Also note that your floater will end up in your corpse, not on the ground. 

Suicide lands you a death but not a kill, so watch those mood swings. :)

Global war engulfs the entire world of Redemption, so NO PLACE IS SAFE. 
You can quit the war at any time by typing {rWAR QUIT{x provided you cool your violence.

War is an extension of Player killing, so all the regular PK rules apply during the war 
(with the exception of level/clan/tier and 30 min. limits on pk).

-0 PKNEWBIES~

{rPK Newbies Clan{x

This clan offers a safe "no-risk" way for people to learn and try actual PK before they 
commit themselves to joining a PK clan. To join talk to a leader or type ({rpknew join{x).
When you join, you will be a part of a special group of PKers in training.  You will have 
a chance to go through a PK School (an area like mud school) that will teach you the basics 
of PK.

Then you can try it out by pking your fellow clan members or other PKers (without any risks 
to those other PKers). You can't be looted, nor can you loot anyone.

Your pk record can only be seen by you and only so that you can measure your own progress.
Once you graduate, your record will be cleared and you will be free to choose a clan to join, 
or choose to remain clanless.

You can only join this clan while you are relatively young, so you can't join at a high level.
Selected IMMs and distinguished mortal PKers may/will lead this clan. They, as well as any 
other IMM, can graduate PKnewbies at any time they think that the person is in the clan for 
wrong reasons, has already learned enough and can go on to the real thing, or if they have 
been in the clan too long, or reached a too high of a level.

All players can also graduate themselves ({rpknew graduate{x) when they feel ready to move on.

-1 ROLE PLAYING RP ROLEPLAY ROLEPLAYING~
...
On Redemption, roleplaying is entirely at your discretion.

This is a basic guide as to how to role-play more efficiently. 
Role-playing, or RP, can and does make mudding a lot more fun. One 
of the keys to role-playing is to be consistent. Have a character and 
always play it the same.

Remember, a character is just that, a character and not you. Try
different things. Don't let things on Redemption or anything on the net
affect you off of the net. This is a screen with words no more. This is
your character on the computer and is make believe. Keep that in mind.
If someone kills you, is rude to you, or trashes anything about you,
remember this is your character, NOT you. React to it as your character
would.

To get into a character, or rather become that character, to ACT and
REACT as the person you have created is not as easy as it may sound. You
must think like the character. ACTING and REACTING are the keys to
role-play *period* If you can do that, the rest is a walk in the park.

To actually do that acting you need to suspend you (the person) from you
(the character). For instance, you may see someone getting insulted or
attacked. Now, you (the person) may want to see that person killed for
their crimes or insults, you may resent them, possibly you will want to
interfere. But, if you (the character) is a blood-thirsty assassin or
reluctant to get into fights, then you would probably not interfere. You
may just cackle, grin, or laugh when things die.

The following is a list of the basics to help you create a character and
role-play that character:

1)You must define your character so, create a history for that character.
{x  Come up with a land from which you came, a family history perhaps. How
{x  did you receive your name? Why did you choose the profession you did?
{x  The complex, detailed, and in depth a history the better. A history is
{x  STRONGLY suggested.
2)Keep in mind your race at all times when role-playing. Certain races
{x  don't like magic or other races etc. For more information on how a
{x  specific race is supposed to act and the like, read the help files for
{x  that race or you can ask your local god.
3)Keep in mind your class when you RP. This can affect a character
{x  greatly. Read the help files for the classes or ask your local god for
{x  more information.
4)Don't forget to make a description for your character. This defines
{x  a character extremely. This is also STRONGLY suggested.
5)Don't make Out of Character comments over any channel except the
{x  designated channels or possibly private channels.
{x  This means ANYTHING. From have a bad day to the score on a sports
{x  event.
6)A good addition to role-play is to act as if you were actually there
{x  in the town. Use it's facilities. Go to the bar, the inn, or anything
{x  anywhere in the Realms. Things like this, using your environment and
{x  resources very helpful.
7)A great thing for role-play are socials and emotes. Emotes more so
{x  than socials because you can add your own quirks and personal spice.
8)Good RP includes a good name. To an extent, there is no limit to
{x  names, as long as you can role-play it. Though some names will still
{x  be restricted, just use common sense and no problems should arise. It is
{x  suggested that you use FANTASY based names, and names that reflect your
{x  character. Certain names go better with different races and classes. If
{x  you need help or suggestions for names ask your gods.
9)Anything can add to RP including your equipment. Sometimes it is
{x  more advantageous to use equipment that reflects your character more
{x  than just the best piece of eq. For example, a dwarven warrior, ;),
{x  could wear the dwarven plate mail or mithril mail. An extremely good or
{x  holy warrior might use Excalibur or a paladins sword. A vampire may
{x  wear bloody cloaks.

-1 MEMBER~
Syntax: member <char>          Invites or removes a member from your clan.
        member <accept|deny>   Accept or Deny an invitation to join a clan.

The first syntax of this command may only be used by the clan leader.

0 COLOUR COLOR ANSI~
Syntax: colour              Toggles colour mode on/off
        colour list         Lists the available colours and channels
        colour #            Sets your default colour to #
        colour <channel> #  Sets the channel colour to #

Use the list option to view a list of all the channels you can set a color
for, along with the color numbers to use for channels and the default color.

Using a number as the only argument will set your default color to this
number. (Default color is the color most text is displayed in)

Using a channel name as the first argument and a number as the second argument
will set this channels color to the number. for example:
       colour gossip 13
This will change the gossip channel color from the default bright blue to
bright magenta.

You may also talk in colour; the format is like this: the 'escape character'
to specify a colour is the left handed brace '{{', following that you should
use one of the following numbers,

         {x{{x     reset, returns to default

         {r{{r     red     {m{{m     magenta
         {g{{g     green   {c{{c     cyan
         {y{{y     yellow  {w{{w     white
         {b{{b     blue    {D{{D     grey{x

For brighter colours, use the shifted numbers: {RR{GG{YY{BB{MM{CC{WW{x
When using colour, it looks better if you finish the line with whatever
colour it would normally be in, such as a gossip, the colour is magenta, so:
                {mLope gossips '{ghello,{r world{m'{x
        looks better than:
                {mLope gossips '{ghello,{r world'{x

152 POINTS~
When running quests and giving out prizes please follow these guidelines:

For easy quests give 2 QP MAX (that means max of TWO points should be
distributed during the quest. Either 2 to a winner or 1 to two people).
These are quests like trivia quests, kill an easy mob, easy find objects etc.

For mediocre quests -  3 IMM QP to the winner (no more than 2 to others. That
is max of FIVE points to be distributed during the quest)
Examples of mediocre quests: kill a hard mob, find things you spread around
the mud, etc.

For harder quests - 5 IMM QP to winner (discretionary to others)
These are quests that take days to plan or hours to play, quests that involve mass
dying, or require a deep knowledge of the mud, or that involve group participation.
Note: {1Winner of NO quest should receive more than 5 IMM QP{x and
      {1No more than 10 IMM QP are to be distributed in ANY quest{x
But keep in mind, 10 is the absolute MAX and should be VERY rare. Usual quests should 
include no more than FIVE points total. These are guidelines for points only. Feel free to
supplement your point prizes by money, items, etc. Use discretion.

When people ask you to redeem their QP (according to the HELP QP):

-  Setting diceroll = increasing value v1 of the object by 1
-  Changing flags is done by (in case u didn't know) : 
{x flag obj <weapon name> weap <flag name>
-  Restringing = please restring ALL THREE fields (short, long, name) Also, when
{x doing a restring for ANYONE, always include "restrung" in the name field.
{x i.e. for Kira's sword do : string obj sword name kira sword restrung
-  Perfect IMM Enchant = you enchant until you get at least 6 enchants in. If the
{x object blows up load another one. If you can't load, clone it before you start
{x enchanting.

0 BRIEF COMPACT~
Brief and compact help set your display options for the game. Typing brief
toggles on and off the showing of room descriptions when you move around
(considerably reducing the text to be processed), and typing compact 
removes the extra blank line before your prompt.
~

0 REALQUIET~
This extreme little command disables a large number of the messages
in the game that do not affect you directly.  By setting this flag,
you will not see people manipulate objects or cast spells, or basically
do any mundane thing that does not affect you directly.  Communications
(including say and tell) are not affected by this flag, and nor is the
ability to see people arrive or leave.

-1 DEAF~
The deaf toggle turns off incoming tells, helpful if you are being bombarded
by messages from other players.  You can still use reply (see 'help reply') to
reply to people who were telling you before you went deaf, although you
cannot reply to a deaf person unless you or they are a deity (it's mostly 
useful for sending a quick "I'm being spammed so I went deaf" message to
a person).
~

-1 AFK REPLAY~
Typing AFK puts your character in a tell-saving mode as follows: any tell
to you is stored in a special buffer, and can be seen later by typing
recall.  This is useful when you need to leave the mud for 5 or 10 minutes,
but don't want to miss tells.  AFK shows up in your prompt until it is
turned off.

Tells to link-dead players are stored in a similar fashion, and can also be

0 NAMES NAMING~

There is a new name rule in effect, it says:

1) No ENGLISH words
2) No OFFENSIVE names

THAT'S IT. That means, specifically that:
a) variations of words, or misspelled words ARE ok.  ex: Fyre
b) combination words ARE ok. ex: SwordDancer (well its a mob, but if it wasnt), LightDragon, etc.

Be ORIGINAL!  Don't take your name from a soap powder or a cartoon character.  Use common sense 
and if you are REALLY stuck, use a fantasy name generator such as the one at: 
http://spitfire.ausys.se/johan/names/

One more exception, names that ARE words MAY be ok if the player has used that name 
for a long long time (we call it "grandfather clause").

~

0 WIZLIST~
Syntax: wizlist

WIZLIST shows the list of the IMMortals of Redemption and their levels.
~

0 DEATH~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the Altar of the Temple
of Midgaard.  Your corpse is left behind in the room where you were killed,
together with all of your equipment.  Unless you are under level 25, in which
case it will be in the morgue (help morgue) with the exception of your floater.

Any spells which were affecting you are cancelled by death.

Following and groups are not affected by death.

You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is two-thirds of 
the way back to the beginning of your level.

Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside (mob) corpses decay with them.
Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real time).
Only the player who died can retrieve objects from his/her own corpse unless
he/she types NOLOOT, in which case anyone can grab the corpse.

**NOTE** When player corpses decay, items in them drop to the ground.
~

0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need a set 
amount of experience points for each level based on your creation points.

You gain experience by:

    being part of a group that kills a monster

You lose experience by:

    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of certain spells
    dying

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your 
alignment
versus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have been killed
lately; and some random variation.
~

0 PET PETS~
You can buy pets in the pet shop.  You may own only one pet at a time, after 
the old one dies you may purchase a replacement.
~

0 BOUNTY~
You can place Bounties on Players through your Clan Leaders ONLY.
Bounties are the level of the player * 25 platinum. 
i.e. for a Bounty on a Level 100 player it is 2500 Platinum.
to remove a Bounty on yourself it is your level * 40 platinum
is to remove a bounty at Level 100 4000 Platinum.
~

0 FLAG FLAGS~
The following are the description flags for players and mobiles:
      {x[{yV{DH{GC{bT{wP{CI{rF{BL{WH{RE{YG{WS{x]
Where:
       {yV{x = Invisible
        {DH{x = Hiding
         {GC{x = Charmed
          {bT{x = Translucent (pass_door)
           {MP{x = Faerie Fire
            {CI{x = Ice Shield
             {rF{x = Fire Shield
              {BL{x = Shock Shield
               {WH{x = Holy Shield /{0{x = Unholy
                {RE{x = Evil
                 {YG{x = Good
                  {WS{x = Sanctuary

The following are the description flags for equipment:
      {x[{yV{RE{BB{MM{YG{WH{GQ{x]
Where:
       {yV{x = Invisible
        {RE{x = Evil
         {BB{x = Blessed
          {MM{x = Magical
           {YG{x = Glowing
            {WH{x = Humming
             {GQ{x = Quest

You may switch to the old format for flags (as used on other
muds) at any time with the 'long' command.
~

0 LONG~
The LONG command will affect the way you see special flags on other
characters and equipment.  With the long flag set, you will see the
flags much as you do on other muds, most of them as (Aura)'s.
Without the long flag (default), you will see any flags within
a much shorter table.  See 'HELP FLAGS' for the shorter tables.
~

0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.
~

0 !~
Syntax: !

! repeats the last command you typed.
~

0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN~
Syntax: north
Syntax: south
Syntax: east
Syntax: west
Syntax: up
Syntax: down

Use these commands to walk in a particular direction.
~

0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells.
~

0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).
~

0 ROB~
Syntax: rob <amount>

While holding a passbook randomly attained by murdering someone in PK, use the 
ROB command to take money from the persons bank account whose passbook you have
attained.  The passbook will dissolve after the rob command is used once.  

Note:  The amount is always in platinum and requires no other argument.
Note:  You can only be successful with an amount less than or equal to the
amount they have deposited and only at a bank they have deposited money at.
see help COMPROMISE.
~

0 COMPROMISED COMPROMISE~

If you have just been murdered or pk'd, your killer now has your passbook.
This means that on typing SCORE, you'll see that one of your accounts will
say COMPROMISED next to it.

Your killer doesn't know which bank your funds are at, so don't advertise
it on channels.  Instead, move the funds as soon as possible to a non-
compromised account.

see help ROB.
~

0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~
Syntax: drop <object>
Syntax: drop <amount> coins
Syntax: get  <object>
Syntax: get  <object> <container>
Syntax: give <object> <character>
Syntax: give <amount> coins <character>
Syntax: put  <object> <container>

DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.

GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even
from a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.

GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.

PUT puts an object into a container.

DROP, GET and PUT understand the object names 'ALL' for all objects and
'ALL.object' for all objects with the same name.
~

0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~
Syntax: equipment
Syntax: inventory

EQUIPMENT lists your equipment (armor, weapons, and held items).
INVENTORY lists your inventory.
~

0 COMPARE~
Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>
Syntax: compare <object>
 
COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,
it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.
 
COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.
 
COMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects.
~

0 KILL MURDER~
Syntax: kill   <mob>
Syntax: murder <player>

The KILL command will attack a mob with your weapons or hands.

The MURDER command will attack a player (within your pk range) with your weapons
or hands.

Note: The MURDER command can be used on mobs and players.  The KILL command can
only be used on mobs.
~

0 AMBUSH~
Syntax: ambush   <victim>

AMBUSH will initiate a fight doing massive amounts of damage at one
time.  You must be wielding a weapon to AMBUSH.  AMBUSH is an attack
for Rangers/Striders and will cause lag for the attacker.
~

0 FINGER~
Syntax: finger <name>
The finger command will tell you the last time a player logged off
the system.  The entered name must match the players name completely,
and cannot be abbreviated.
~

0 FLEE~
Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue   <character>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, then fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.
~

0 METAL ARMOR~
Syntax:  Metalarmor
This skill is an AC boost for Gladiator's and Mercenary's Only.
~
0 MITHRIL GLAZE~
Syntax:  cast mithril glaze <item>

~

0 ORDER~
Syntax: order <character> command
Syntax: order all command

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggressive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.
~

0 REST SLEEP STAND SIT WAKE~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake
Syntax: sit
Syntax: sit in <object>
Syntax: sit on <object>

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.

Use SIT to sit on or in an object in the room.  If used alone you
will sit on the ground.
~

0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~
Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''
is a synonym for SAY.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.

boards is restricted. The 'unread' command can be used to show your unread
notes on all the note spools.
~

Syntax: answer  <message>
Syntax: shout   <message>
Syntax: yell    <message>
Syntax: channels
Syntax: quiet

SHOUT sends a message to all awake players in the world.  To curb excessive

only to those who are clanned.
'.' is a synonym for IC.

QGOSSIP sends a message to everyone with an IMMortal quest flag on during an
IMMortal quest.

ASK and ANSWER are channels that work together as a way for players to gain
information about the mud and to get help.

The AUCTION channel is for players to sell and buy valuables publicly.

OOC is the out of character channel.  This is the only channel where real life
emotions, feelings, and comments should be expressed.  Other channels are
considered in character and to be used to express the feelings, emotions, and
comments of your character regardless of real life situations.

GRATS is used for congratulating characters on accomplishments such as leveling,
heroing, etc.  Triggers on this channel are FROWNED upon.  Annoying triggers will
cause the player activating them to have bad health.

The MUSIC channel is used for singing.  This is a global channel and can be heard all
over the mud.  (Please be on pitch)

QUOTE is a global channel used for quoting interesting comments.

YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.

CHANNELS shows you a list of the channels available to you and whether or not you have
them turned on or off.

QUIET turns off all channels except for say and emote.  This includes tells as well.

Type a channel name by itself to turn it off.
~

0 FORGET REMEMBER~
Syntax: forget   <character>
	remember <character>

Forgetting a player will block out all global messages from that player.
Local messages (say, emote, etc..) will still be visible.

Remember will remove a player from your forget list.

Use either command without an argument for a list of players currently
forgotten.
~

0 DEPOSIT WITHDRAW BANK BANKING~
Syntax: deposit  <amount>
Syntax: withdraw <amount>

DEPOSIT and WITHDRAW are used for banking on Redemption.  DEPOSIT adds money to your
account at the bank you are located at.  WITHDRAW takes money from your account at
the bank you are located at.  You can only WITHDRAW money from a branch that you
have DEPOSITED money into.

Note: Amount is always in platinum.  There is no need to specify a type of currency.

0 NOSUMMON~
Syntax:  nosummon

NOSUMMON toggles your ability to be summoned and/or gated to by other players.

Syntax: emote <action>
Syntax: pose

EMOTE is used to express emotions or actions.  Besides EMOTE, there are
several dozen built-in social commands, such as CACKLE, HUG, and THANK
(type socials for a listing).

PMOTE is similar to emote, but will substitute you and your for a target's
name (i.e. pmote bonks Alander will be read as bonks you by Alander, and
as bonks Alander by everyone else).

POSE produces a random message depending on your class.
~

152 SMOTE~
Syntax: smote <action>

Smote works exactly like pmote, except you must place your name somewhere in
the string, and it will show that string to everyone in the room.
~

0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~
Syntax: hold   <object>
Syntax: remove <object>
Syntax: wear   <object>

Syntax: time
Syntax: weather

AREAS shows you a list of areas in the game.

COMMANDS shows you all the commands in the game.

SCORE shows much more detailed statistics to you only.
Your ability scores are shown as true value(current value), so for example
Str: 15(23) means you have a 15 strength from training, but a 23 strength
from other factors (spells or items).  

SHOW allows you to see your affects within your SCORE.  

WORTH is similar to SCORE but will only display your coins, your total 
experience gained since birth, and the amount of experience you need to gain 
your next level.

TIME shows the game time, as well as the time the mud was last started,
and the current local time for the host computer.

WEATHER shows the current game weather.

your hit points below your wimpy value, you will automatically attempt to flee.
You will only flee if your character is not in a wait state -- i.e. has not
been using combat commands like cast, trip and bash, and has not been
tripped or bash by an enemy.

WIMPY with no argument sets your wimpy value to 20% of your maximum hit points.

Some monsters are wimpy.

0 OPEN CLOSE LOCK UNLOCK PICK BASDOOR~
Syntax: open     <object|direction>
Syntax: close    <object|direction>
Syntax: lock     <object|direction>
Syntax: unlock   <object|direction>
Syntax: pick     <object|direction>

by successfully knocking the door down.  Like pick, the appropriate skill
must be practiced to BASHDOOR successfully.
~

0 SHARPEN~
Syntax:  sharpen <weapon>

~

0 BUY LIST SELL VALUE~
Syntax: buy   <object>
Syntax: list
Syntax: sell  <object>
Syntax: value <object>

BUY buys an object from a shop keeper.
When multiple items of the same name are listed, type 'buy n.item', where n
is the position of the item in a list of that name.  So if there are two
swords, buy 2.sword will buy the second. If you want to buy multiples of
an item, use an * (buy 5*pie will buy 5 pies).  These can be combined into
(for example) buy 2*2.shield, as long as the * is first.  

LIST lists the objects the shop keeper will sell you.
List <name> shows you only objects of that name.

SELL sells an object to a shop keeper.

VALUE asks the shop keeper how much he, she, or it will buy the item for.

~

0 SACRIFICE~
Syntax: sacrifice <object>

SACRIFICE offers an object to your god, who may reward you.

~

0 SCROLL PAGING ROWS~
Syntax: scroll

This command changes the number of lines the mud sends you in a page (the 
default is 24 lines).  Change this to a higher number for larger screen
sizes, or to 0 to disabling paging.
~

0 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP~
Syntax: brandish
Syntax: quaff    <potion>
Syntax: recite   <scroll> <target>
Syntax: zap      <target>
Syntax: zap

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed
to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the
<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a
magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting
someone, then that character is used for a target.

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single
charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no
more charges, it will be consumed.

These commands may require an item skill to be successful, see the help entries
on the skills scrolls, staves, and wands for more information.
~

0 CONSIDER~
Syntax: consider <character>

CONSIDER tells you what your chances are of killing a character.
Of course, it's only a rough estimate and doesn't take their weapon
into consideration.
~

0 FOLLOW GROUP NOFOLLOW~
Syntax: follow <character>
Syntax: group
Syntax: group <character>
Syntax: nofollow

FOLLOW starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone else,
just FOLLOW <yourself>.

NOFOLLOW toggles your ability to follow others or have anyone follow you.  It
also terminates any groups of which you are the leader.

GROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and
SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight (unless you have autoassist switched off).

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.

You may FOLLOW and GROUP only with characters who are within five levels of
your own.
~

0 VISIBLE~
VISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
making you visible again.
~

0 QUIT RENT SAVE~
Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: RENT ... not!
Syntax: SAVE

SAVE saves your character and object.  The game saves your character every
15 minutes regardless, and is the preferred method of saving.  Typing save
will block all other command for about 20 seconds, so use it sparingly.
(90+ players all typing save every 30 seconds just generated too much lag)

Some objects, such as keys, may not be saved.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere.  When you re-enter the 
game 
you will be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

There is no RENT in this mud.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.
~

0 PUSH DRAG~
Syntax:  push <target>
Syntax:  drag <target>

PUSH allows you to push a {Rviolent player{x from the room in which he/she/it is
standing.

DRAG is similar to PUSH except you go with the person.

Success of PUSH and DRAG depend upon your size versus your targets as well as
the amount of hit-pts you both have.

Note:  Both you and the target must be flagged {Rviolent{x.

offerings at the chapel of the god whose alignment you wish to be.  Both chapels
are located in Midgaard and are on the Map of Midgaard.
~

0 RECALL /~
Syntax: RECALL

RECALL prays to your god for miraculous transportation from where you are
back to the Temple of Midgaard.  '/' is a synonym for RECALL.
If you are a member of a clan that has it's own reincarnation room,
your god will transport you there, unless you have been labeled a thief
or killer.

If you RECALL during combat, you will lose experience (more than for fleeing),
and you will have a chance of failing (again, more than for fleeing).  This
chance is based on your recall skill, although a 100% recall does not 
insure success.

RECALL costs 1/4 of your movement points.

RECALL doesn't work in certain god-forsaken rooms.  Characters afflicted by a
curse may not recall at all.
~

-1 SPLIT~
Syntax: SPLIT <silver> <gold>

SPLIT splits some coins  between you and all the members of your
group who are in the same room as you.  It's customary to SPLIT
the loot after a kill.  The first argument is the amount of silver
the split (0 is acceptable), and the second gold (optional).
Examples:
split 30 	--> split 30 silver
split 20 50	--> split 20 silver, 50 gold
split  0 10	--> split 10 gold
~

0 STEAL~
Syntax: STEAL coins <character>
Syntax: STEAL <object> <character>

0 PRACTICE~
Syntax: PRACTICE
Syntax: PRACTICE <skill|spell>

PRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in all
the skills and spells available to you.  You can check this anywhere.

PRACTICE with an argument practice that skill or spell.  Your learning
percentage varies from 0% (unlearned) to a some maximum between 80% and 100%,
depending on your class.  You must be at a guild master to practice.

The higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice
session.  The higher your wisdom, the more practice sessions you will
have each time you gain a level.  Unused sessions are saved until you
do use them.
~

0 TRAIN~
Syntax: train <str int wis dex con hp mana>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class, and several
initial training sessions.  You can increase your attributes by
using these sessions at a trainer (there are several in town).

It takes one training session to improve an attribute, or to increase
mana or hp by 10.  You receive one session per level.

The best attributes to train first are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more
practice when you gain a level.  CON gives you more hit points.
In the long run, your character will be most powerful if you train
WIS and CON both to 18 before practicing or training anything else.
~

160 ADVANCE~
Syntax: advance <character> <level>

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.
~

161 TRUST~
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
~

160 REBOOT SHUTDOWN COPYOVER~
Syntax: reboot
	shutdown
        copyover

Reboot shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of fifteen seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

Shutdown shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.

Copyover is a hot reboot which allows the players to stay on the game.
~

152 CLONE~
Syntax:
  clone obj <object>
  clone mob <mobile>
  clone <name>

The clone command duplicates an object or mobile.  The level of item or mobile
that may be cloned depends on your level.  The target object or mob must be in
the same room as you, or in your posession.  Strung and set information is
preserved by clone, as well as any spell effects a nd container contents or
mobile inventory, except for items which are too high for you to clone.  
~

159 WIZLOCK NEWLOCK~
Syntax: wizlock
	newlock

Wizlock and newlock both block login attempts to ROT. Wizlock locks
out all non-gods (i.e. level less than 152), except for link-dead players who
are returning.  Newlock only locks out new character generation, typically
used for preventing a spammer from returning.  Wizlocking should be avoided,
and newlocking should be accompanied by mail or a note to the imps.
~

157 DENY ERASE~
Syntax: deny <name>
        erase <name>

DENY and ERASE lock a character out of a game permanently, rendering their
character name unusable.  They may only be removed by editing the pfile, for
this reason freeze is usually preferred.

If a player is DENY'd, they will be sent a message telling them so, then
will be forced to quit.  They will then receive a message telling them
they are denied access any time they try to connect.

If a player is ERASED, they will receive no message, and will be immediately
disconnected.  They will immediately be disconnected any time they attempt
to connect, with no explanation.
~

155 DISCONNECT IDISCONNECT~
Syntax: idisconnect <name>
Syntax: idisconnect <port number>

Disconnect breaks a player's link to the game, dumping them back to the telnet
prompt.  This is a non-lethal way of getting rid of spammers and annoying
players.  Use 'sockets' command to find the port they entered the mud on.
~

157 FREEZE JAIL~
Syntax: freeze <name>
Syntax: jail   <name>

FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all. It can be removed from within the game, so freezing a 
troublemaker is usually a better option than they deny command.
JAIL is a one word command for corner, freeze, deny -- permanently.
~

156 CORNER~
Syntax: corner <name>

CORNER <character> puts the character in the corner.
Basically its the same as 'trans <player> 3'.

channel, with the text of your choice.
~
155 CHECK~
Syntax: check        display info about players
        check stats  display info and resume stats
        check eq     resume eq of all players

If there are a lot of players on, DO NOT use 'check eq' as this may cause
the mud to crash.
Use the stat command in case of doubt about someone.
~

158 DUPE~
Syntax: dupe <character> <name>

DUPE will add or remove a dupe account name to a list kept on the players
account.  Anytime this player connects, all characters on their dupe list
will be forced to quit (except immortals).  This should be used only on
those who flagrantly violate the rule against bringing in more than one
character at a time and using one character to build a second.  Entering
a dupe that is already on the list will cause it to be removed.

Using DUPE <character> without the second argument will list that
characters current dupes.
~

158 FORCE FORCEDELETE~
Syntax: force <character> <command>
Syntax: force all <command>
Syntax: forcedelete <player>

FORCE forces one character to execute a command, except of course delete.

Below level 159 force can only be used on mobiles.

FORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command.
This is typically used for 'force all save'.

FORCEDELETE forces a character to delete, typically after they have been
ploaded.
~

152 SOCKETS~
Syntax: sockets
	sockets <name> 

SOCKETS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including 
users in the process of logging in.  The two numbers inside brackets are the 
channel number and the 'connected' state.  The 'connected' states are listed in 
merc.h: 0 is CON_PLAYING; non-zero values are various states of logging in.

The optional name argument shows the site of a player, or optional can be used
to identify switched gods (i.e. socket orc shows the name of anyone switched
into an orc).
~

153 LOAD~
Syntax: load mob <vnum>
	load obj <vnum> <level>

The load command is used to load new objects or mobiles (use clone to 
duplicate strung items and mobs).  

Vnums can be found with the vnum command, or by stat'ing an existing mob or object.

Load puts objects in inventory if they can be carried, otherwise they are
put in the room.  Mobiles are always put into the same room as the god.
(see also clone, stat)
~

155 SET~
Syntax: set mob   <mobile> <field> <value>
	set obj   <object> <field> <value>
	set room  <number> <field> <value>
	set skill <char>   <name>  <rating>
	set skill <char>   all     <rating>

The set command is used to change the numerical values of the various data
structures. Type set <class> without an argument to see a listing of options.
Set skill all (pc's only) will set all the character's skills to the value
given.  Use string to change the strings on an object or mobile.
(see also string, stat, flag)
~

152 STRING RESTRING~
Syntax: string obj <field> <string>
	string mob <field> <string>

The string command changes the various strings associated with an object or
mobile.  A full list of fields can be viewed by typing string obj or string

	norestore <character>
	noshout   <character>
	notell    <character>
	notitle   <character>
        noviolent <character>

NOEMOTE, NOSHOUT, and NOTELL are used to muffle other characters, by
preventing them from emoting, shouting, and telling, respectively.
Characters who are noshout'ed or no'telled will also not receive those
forms of communication.

The NOCHANNEL command is similar, but more drastic. It prevents the victim
from using any of the channels (gossip, cgossip, Q/A, music) on the game.
Nochannels usually result from swearing or spamming on public channels.

The NORESTORE command makes a player immune to the restore command.
This is used to punish players who constantly ask for restores from
immortals.

The NOCLAN command makes a player unable to join pkill-type clans.
This is used to punish players who are known to cause serious troubles
with pkilling.

The NOTITLE command makes a player unable to set their own title.
This is used to punish players who use the title for swearing,
threats, etc....

The NOVIOLENT command clears a players violent flag.  (So that they can
leave the mud in the case of a hurried shutdown for example).
~

159 TWIT PARDON~
Syntax: twit   <character>
        pardon <character>

TWIT sets the Twit flag on a player.  When set, the twit flag causes
any mobiles in a LAW room (all of Midgaard) to attack the player,
and the shopkeepers will not sell to the player.  Also, any player may
attack and kill a player with the twit flag, whether they can normally
pkill or not.

PARDON will remove the Twit flag if set.
~

152 PURGE~
Syntax: purge
	purge <character>

Purge is used to clean up the world.  Purge with no arguments removes all the
NPC's and objects in the current room.  Purge with an argument purges one
character from anywhere in the world.

Purge will not get rid of PC's, or objects or mobiles with a NOPURGE flag
set (i.e. the pit, the fountain, shopkeepers, Hassan).  Mobiles may be
purged if they are called directly by name.
~

159 RESTORE~
Syntax: restore <character>
	restore room
	restore all

Restore restores full hit points, mana points, and movement points to the
target character.  It also heals poison, plague, and blindness.

Restore room (or restore with no argument) performs a restore on every player
in the room, restore all does the same for all connected players. Restore all
is only usable by creators and implementors.  Restore should be used sparingly
or not at all.

Restore doesn't work on violent players.
~

158 SLAY~
Syntax: slay <character>

Slay kills a character in cold blood, no saving throw.  Best not to use this
command on players if you enjoy being a god.
~

152 TRANSFER TELEPORT~
Syntax: transfer <character>
	transfer all
	transfer <character> <location>
	transfer all         <location>

Transfer transfers the target character, or ALL player characters,
to your current location (default) or to a specified location. Trans all 
should almost never be used, as 100 players popping into one room can have
horrible effects on slow links. Teleport is a synonym for transfer. 
~

152 RECOVER~
Syntax: recover <character>

Recover transfers the target character to their default recall point.
You may only recover a character who is either cursed, or is stuck in
a no-recall area.
~

154 AT~
Syntax: at <location> <command>

At executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given
location.  The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of
a mobile, or as the name of an object.

At works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the
command, and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your
location).
~

153 ECHO GECHO PECHO ZECHO WECHO~
Syntax: echo  <message>
	gecho <message>
        zecho <message>
	pecho <character> <message>

These commands all perform similar functions.  Echo sends the message to
all characters in the same room as the user, with no indication of who sent
it.  Gecho does the same for all players connected to the game, and pecho
sends the message to the player specified as the target.  Zecho sends an echo
into that zone or area only.  Wecho is the bright red and blue announcement 
used by 160 Gods.  Any higher-level god will see a prompt in front of your 
message, informing him or her that it is an echo.
~

152 GOTO VIOLATE~
Syntax: goto
        goto <location>
        violate <location>

Goto takes you to a location.  The location may be specified as a vnum,
as the name of a mobile, or as the name of an object.

Goto with no argument will take you to your default location if you
have one set. (see GSET)  If used in this manner, your pet will be
transferred with you.

You may not Goto a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters
already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters
already present. Some other rooms are barred to players below a certain
god level.

Creators can use the VIOLATE command to get into private rooms.
~

152 GSET~
Syntax: gset <vnum>

Gset allows you to set the default location for the goto command to
take you to.
~

152 HOLYLIGHT INVIS WIZINVIS~
Syntax: holylight
	wiznvis <level>

Holylight is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

Wizinvis takes a level argument, and will make you invisible to all players of
a lower level than your invisibility level.  It defaults to the maximum
(your level) if no argument is given.  Wizi 160 characters are totally 
invisible.
~

152 INCOGNITO GHOST~

Toggling your incognito status will hide your presence from people outside the
room you are in, but leave you visible to those who are with you.

Toggling your ghost status will do the exact opposite, making you invisible
to anyone in the same room as you, but visible to those outside the room.
While ghost is set, you will still appear visible to all characters in the
game through the 'who' command. (depending on your wizinv level)

Both take a level argument similar to wizinvis, people at that level
or higher can see you regardless of location.
These flags are mutually exclusive, turning on one will automatically turn
the other off.
~

152 MEMORY~
Syntax: memory

Memory reports the size of your mud.

The 'Mobs' and 'Objs' lines report the number of types of mobiles and objects,
not the number of instances currently in the game.

The 'Strings' line shows memory used by area-file strings.  These strings have
a maximum limit, which is also shown.

The 'Perms' line shows permanently allocated memory blocks.  There is no limit
on the number and size of these blocks.
~

153 VNUM~
Syntax: vnum <name>
	vnum <obj or mob> <name>
	vnum skill <name>
	vnum area

Vnum finds all objects and mobiles with a particular name, and prints out
the results.  Use vnum obj or vnum mob to limit the search.  This vnum is
very useful for loading. Vnum skill returns the skill number (for set) and
the slot number (for making new zones) of a skill name. Vnum area lists
all areas and their range of vnums.
(see also load)
~

152 STAT~
Syntax: stat <name>
	stat mob  <name>
	stat obj  <name>
	stat room <number>

The stat command gives you detailed information on an object, mobile, or room
within the game.  Without a class argument, the command will return a object
(if found), a mobile (if no object exists, but a mobile does), or a room 
(if a number is  given).  Stat room with no argument stats the room you are
standing in.  Stat can be used to find room vnums for goto.
(see also goto, transfer)
~

allowing (for example) weapons to do more damage to particularly holy
opponents.

reveal a characteristic red aura.

0 'DISPEL MAGIC' CANCELLATION~
Syntax: cast 'dispel magic' <character>
        cast 'cancellation' <character>
 
Both of these spells remove magical effects from the target.  Dispel magic

Cancellation can only be used on allies, but is much more effective and does
not provoke attack.  Unfortunately, the spells do not discriminate between
harmful and benign spells.  Mobs cannot use cancellation.
 
The chance of dispelling is based on the level of the spell. Permanent spells
(such as mobile sanctuary) are much harder to remove.  Not all spells may
be dispelled, notable examples are poison and plague.

used to buy incredible items from the questmaster.

The QUEST code comes from Vassago's quest snippet.

The QUEST command is used for information about your current quest, to
request a quest from a questmaster, etc. Commands are as follows:

QUEST POINTS - Gives your current number of quest points. This command
mayh be used anywhere.

QUEST INFO - If you are on a quest, this will remind you who or what you
are after.

QUEST TIME - Gives the amount of time remaining on your current quest, or
the amount of time until you can request another quest. This command may
be used anywhere.

QUEST REQUEST - Petitions the questmaster to send you on a quest. If you
accept the quest, you will be given a realtime limit (in minutes) in
which you must complete the quest. If you are on a quest to kill a
creature, when you come across that creature you will see a [TARGET]
notice before it. This is the creature you are to kill.

QUEST COMPLETE - Once you have completed your quest and recovered the item
or killed the mob or whatever. you must return to the questmaster who sent
you on the quest and use this command. If you have successfully completed
your quest, he will reward you with gold and quest points. once you
complete a quest you cannot request another for 10 minutes (real time).

QUEST LIST - Displays the list of fabulous items for sale by the
questmaster. These items are not ableto be bought with gold. They must be purchased
with quest points.

QUEST BUY <item> - purchases an item from the questmaster and deducts the
cost of the item from your quest points.

QUEST QUIT -  This is a command to dismiss extremely hard or un-doable quests,
from Brother John the Questmaster.

-1 STANCE~

{xSyntax: {Gsskill{g               (to see your proficiency in it)
{xSyntax: {Gstance{g               (to relax the stance){x

In combat, the stance of the fighter plays a very important role; you 
can't just stand there and exchange blow for blow unless you are very 
confident of your ability.  Each fighting stance has advantages and 
disadvantages, the basic outline of which follows:

{GVIPER : {gA very fast and aggressive style of combat, concentrating 
{g        on striking your opponent before they have the chance to 
{g        avoid or block you.
{GCRANE : {gA wide, sweeping style of combat, which concentrates on a 
{g        very strong blocking defence.
{GCRAB :  {gA low, defensive fighting stance which uses agile footwork 
{g        and rolling with attacks in order to reduce your injuries.
{GMONGOOSE: {gA light-footed stance which relies on leaps and acrobatics 
{g          to ensure that by the time your opponent makes their 
{g          attack, you've moved out of the way.
{GBULL :  {gA low aggressive stance which concentrates purely on 
{g        physical power.

{xOnce you are in a stance, you can type '{Gsskill{x' to see how skilled

you are in that particular stance and what your percentage is.  This 
only works when you are in that stance.

-1 ADVANCEDSTANCE~

{CAdvanced stances {ccan be learned after you have become a grand master in 
two normal stances.  These stances are much better than the others.

{CMANTIS : {cRequires {CCRANE {cand {CVIPER {cbefore it can be learned.  This 
{c         stance combines a very strong defence with lightning fast 
{c         counter attacks.
{CDRAGON : {cRequires {CBULL {cand {CCRAB {cbefore it can be learned.  This stance 
{c         uses very powerful attacks, as well as protecting the fighter 
{c         from injury.
{CTIGER :  {cRequires {CBULL {cand {CVIPER {cbefore it can be learned.  Probably 
{c         the most aggressive of all the stances, this style utilizes 
{c         very powerful and lightning fast attacks.
{CMONKEY : {cRequires {CCRANE {cand {CMONGOOSE {cbefore it can be learned.  The 
{c         only affect of this stance is to completely nullify the 
{c         advantages of your opponents stance.
{CSWALLOW: {cRequires {CMONGOOSE {cand {CCRAB {cbefore it can be learned.  This 
{c         is the most defensive of all the stances, combining agile 
{c         dodges with the ability to 'roll' with an attack, helping 
{c         prevent injury.
