-1 STORY~
.{&
In the beginning of the realm, there came a light in the vast darkness of
the condition known as existence.  The one known as F'nor came and claimed
the lands around as his own.  He was kind, and the light he brought was
very appreciated by the masses of people that had been living in darkness
for so long.  F'nor, and his dragon Canth, were Gods in the eyes of those
around.  But there was one who remembered the darkness.  One who found the
light to be oppressing, and not as benevolent as those around.  Her heart
was as pitch, black and thick with hatred.  This one was Ezmirel.
     Ezmirel had seen how F'nor did his tricks and powers, and soon taught
herself to emulate those powers, although she could not match F'nor's power
in those skills.  She planned to overthrow F'nor and return the world to
the state of darkness it was before, the way she remembered and loved.
Unfortunately for Ezmirel, the people of the realm as a whole did not
wish to return to those days as she did.  A very few agreed with Ezmirel,
but most all sided with F'nor.  Ezmirel grew very angry, and took to very
violent acts and subterfuge to spread her ideas about the absence of
light.  She slandered the light, and spread lies saying it was evil, but
the people saw through her attempts at deception, and grew to hate her 
even more.  Finally Ezmirel just threw herself totally against F'nor,
thinking that with F'nor out of the way, she would be able to rule
completely, and the people would grow to love her just as much as they now
loved F'nor.
     F'nor loved the people he had brought out of the darkness, and he
could not bring himself to stand by and watch this Ezmirel attack some of
these people just because they liked it better light.  F'nor decided that
even though he loved peace, this one must be pacified one way or the
other.  He tried to talk to this hater of light, but Ezmirel just threw
hate back in his face, and even tried to bring about F'nor's death, which
Canth saved him from.  So F'nor, under advice from some of his closest new
friends, decided that he had to fight back.
     There came a time one fine bright day, when Ezmirel just all out
attacked F'nor.  She did this in front of a multitude of people.  F'nor had
been advised to expect this by some who knew of Ezmirel before F'nor's
arrival, so he was fully ready.  F'nor had learned of Ezmirel's power and
made himself immune to that attack, and struck back at Ezmirel with a
fierce power of his own.  Ezmirel was caught totally unaware by the
ferocity of this attack by the normally peaceful F'nor.  F'nor totally
decimated Ezmirel that day, and Ezmirel, defeated soundly, retreated to
recover her wounds, and pride.
     F'nor knows that Ezmirel was not beaten permanently, as she was always
too tenacious in her hatred, but for the time being, Ezmirel has been
pacified.  There will most likely come a time when Ezmirel feels prepared
enough to strike again, but until that time, the Light reigns supreme,
and F'nor is still most loved by the people of the realm.

-1 PHOENIX~
. {R The Phoenix are a race that has evolved into these Fighting Birds of prey.
As with most races that fly and depend on there ability to see, not much misses
these Birds. They are also Highly resistant to disease and poison. They 
are immune to fire for the obvious reasons and vulnerable to cold.
This race is good for mages, clerics, druids, and rangers; they do not make 
good warriors, thieves, or vampires. {x
~
-1 Rules~
These are the rules of Phoenix.  For other matters, use common sense.
For clan specific rules, see HELP CLANRULES.

*  Your presense here is a PRIVILEGE, not a right.  Obey any orders from gods, and you will be fine.  Deletion does not require a reason, appeals are to be sent to the implementors

*  No harassment will be tolerated.  This mean no sexual harrasments, no harassment baised on someone's sexual belief, and no harrasment of Immortals of any kind.  Penalties for this range from being cornered for 24 or more hours to deletion of character,

 to banning of site. 

*  Bug exploitation is cheating.  Anyone caught exploiting a bug, however inadvertant will be punished.  Minimum penalty for this is slay/eat corpse.

* There is limited player stealing or player killing. You have to join a clan to do either.

* A member of a PK clan may kill a member of any other PK clan. (Clan alliance matters are for clan leaders to sort out)

* A member of a clan may steal from a member of any other clan.

* If you join a clan, and someone either pkills you, or psteals from you, do not complain to the gods, or ask the gods to return your eq or do a corpse retrieval for you, as they are forbidden from doing so

* Sitting around idle with a client is hazardous to your health. If we catch you doing it, strange things may happen to your character.


*  No Swearing on public channels of ANY kind.  This includes attempting to mask you swearing with words like phuck, etc. Same applies to public areas and notes.

* NO MULTIPLAYING. This includes multiple logins, playing 2 or more of your characters or helping your own characters with other characters you own -- by any arrangment.  Multiplaying encompases -any- type of interaction or help between two characters tha

t you own (such as dropping eq with 1 and picking it up with the other, summoning yourself, summoning gate mobs for yourself, using wizard eye, locate, or anything else involving PK.) Note: you do not have to have 2 chars logged on at the same time to be 

guilty of multiplaying.  Penalty for breaking the multiplaying rule is from slay and corpse eat to erasure of the characters.

* No kill stealing.  This means you cannot attack a mob someone else is 
  fighting, unless they ask you to. Also avoid attacking fleeing mobs.

* Do not ask a god to make you a member of a clan.  The request to add
  you to a clan must come from the clan leader.  Ask a member of the clan who their leader is.


* The ruling of the Immortals, reguardless of rank, is final.  Attempting to go over an Immortal's head to one of higher level will usually not result in any change except the rolling of your head.  The Imps all read the penalty boards, and as such, are a

ware of what punishment is given for what action.

* Changes to these rules are at the discretion of the immortals, and may be done without warning, notice, or even evidence of sanity. Walk softly,  and carry a black stick. 

***********************   PHOENIX ADDITIONS  ***************************


1)  There is NO dropping eq/bags and Picking it up again After a re-roll. When You reroll ALL your eq is GONE !

2)  There is only ONE {!Q{@U{#E{$S{&T{x sword/dagger/lance Allowed Per Character after a crash or some other such mishap.  In Other words if the Mud crashes and You loose ALL your eq the Imms will only replace One of your Phoenix weapons.  The others are up to you 

to replace.

3)  NO Interaction between Dupes! None of ANY Kind... NO exceptions. This means EVERYONE, GODS included. Keep Your dupes Separated. See above for explanation of multiplayin.

ng any clan can be TWITed by requst of a clan-leader, no explanations or justifications are required.

12) Any first tier players caught with a F'nors Sphere (or a restrung one), or 
    a second tier player with more than one, will be slain and made a BBQ of!

13) Asking for summons on public channels will land you a free transport to an immortal place of their choice. (Unless you are under 25 and use an Ask channel)

-1 FELINE~

. {rThe Feline are a race descended from the great cats. For long years in
their past, the Feline were enslaved by wizards to serve as familiars.
 They are renowned, however, for their agility and their "nine lives". 
It is said a Feline can withstand blows in battle (or from an angry master) 
that would kill a human outright.

The thick fur of the Feline makes them resistant to cold, but also very
vulnerable to fire. They also abhor water and are liable to drown in
it. Despite heavy modification by their former masters, the Feline
retain the large claws and fangs of their ancestors. This gives them
the ability to inflict extra damage during a fight, but the claws are
not retractable so it is difficult for a Feline to walk unnoticed. The
Feline are also famed for their street fighting ability. 

Feline tend to be smaller than humans, averaging about 5' in height.
They have a very muscular builds, though, more so than would be expected. 
Fur on feline's can run from almost none to 90% of their body covered. 
Their colorings vary.{x

When a global war is started you can join the war by typing {rWAR JOIN{x. During the war most of the PK restrictions are removed. The pk-level limit is extended to 20 up and down. This means that cross-tiers, non-pk clan members, non-clanned people, and p

eople of same clans can fight each other within the war level limits.  

When  you die you and your corpse are transported to the war body collection center. Fighting in the war body collection center is not allowed. You should stay there untill you are fully recouperated before you rejoin the war.  

For all of those worried about your things, dying does not affect rot_death eq, PK records, your corpse is safe from looting and there will be no voodooes or zombies of you terrorizing the public. Also note that your floater will end up in your corpse, no

t on the ground. 

Suicide lands you a death but not a kill, so watch those mood swings :)

Global war engulfs the entire world of Phoenix, so NO PLACE IS SAFE. 
You can quit the war at any time by typing {rWAR QUIT{x provided you cool your violence.

War is an extension of Player killing, so all the regular PK rules apply during the war (with the exception of level/clan/tier and 30 min. limits on pk).

-1 ROLE PLAYING RP~
.

This is a basic guide as to how to role-play more efficiently. Phoenix
is a role-playing mud, so be prepared to role-play as much as possible.
There are several consequences for not role-playing. They can be
anything from just telling you, to a nochannel, to possible deletion
(this is very unlikely but you never know). So the overall theme of
this  is to role-play. Role-playing, or RP, can and does make mudding a
lot more fun. That is for you and others. One of the keys to
role-playing is to be consistent. Have a character and always play it
the same.
Remember, a character is just that, a character and not you. Try
different things. Don't let things on Phoenix or anything on the net
affect you off of the net. This is a screen with words no more. This is
your character on the computer and is make believe. Keep that in mind.
If someone kills you, is rude to you, or trashes anything about you,
remember this is your character, NOT you. React to it as your character
would.
The immortals will be watching and keeping tabs on the RP on Phoenix.
They or others will ask you questions about you and your life. All of
the thing that are stated in this file will be watched for.
To get into a character, or rather become that character, to ACT and
REACT as the person you have created is not as easy as it may sound. You
must think like the character. ACTING and REACTING are the keys to
role-play *period* If you can do that, the rest is a walk in the park.
To actually do that acting you need to suspend you (the person) from you
(the character). For instance, you may see someone getting insulted or
attacked. Now, you (the person) may want to see that person killed for
their crimes or insults,  you may resent them, possibly you will want to
interfere. But, if you (the character) is a blood-thirsty assassin or
reluctant to get into fights, then you would probably not interfere. You
may just cackle, grin, or laugh when things die.
The following is a list of the basics to help you create a character and
role-play that character:
1)  You must define your character so, create a history for that
character. The gods or other mortals may ask you for your background.
Come up with a land from which you came, a family history perhaps. How
did you receive your name? Why did you choose the profession you did?
The complex, detailed, and in depth a history the better. A history is
STRONGLY suggested.
2)  Keep in mind your race at all times when role-playing. Certain races
don't like magic or other races etc. For more information on how a
specific race is supposed to act and the like, read the help files for
that race or you can ask your local god.
3)  Keep in mind your class when you RP. This can affect a character
greatly. Read the help files for the classes or ask your local god for
more information.
4)  Don't forget to make a description for your character. This defines
a character extremely. This is also STRONGLY suggested.
5)  Don't make Out of Character comments over any channel except the
designated channels or possibly private channels.
  This means ANYTHING. From have a bad day to the score on a sports
event.
6)  A good addition to role-play is to act as if you were actually there
in the town. Use it's facilities. Go to the bar, the inn, or anything
anywhere in the Realms. Things like this, using your environment and
resources very helpful.
7)  A great thing for role-play are socials and emotes. Emotes more so
than socials because you can add your own quirks and personal spice.
   Examples of some role-playing emotes are:
a)  Puck grunts throatily.
b)  Puck burps loudly and disgustingly.
c)  Puck nods in recognition.
d)  Puck raises his ax high in the air and charges forward with fire in
his eyes!
8)  Along the same lines as the emotes, are to add quirks. Such as,
limps, accents, physical deformities, scars, and more.
  Examples:
a)  Puck limps toward you.
b)  Puck says," How are ye doin this day?"
c)  As Puck stretches his ax arm, a deep scar running the length of his
fore-arm festers and bleeds.
9)  Good RP includes a good name. To an extent, there is no limit to
names, as long as you can role-play it. Though some names will still
be restricted, just use common sense and no problems should arise. It is
suggested that you use FANTASY based names, and names that reflect your
character. Certain names go better with different races and classes. If
you need help or suggestions for names ask your gods.
10)  Anything can add to RP including your equipment. Sometimes it is
more advantageous to use equipment that reflects your character more
than just the best piece of eq. For example, a dwarven warrior, ;),
could wear the dwarven plate mail or mithril mail. An extremely good or
holy warrior might use Excalibur or a paladins sword. A vampire may
wear bloody cloaks.
11)  Remember all aspects of a character. From height, weight, and age
to your description, background, and habits. Everything is a factor.

A contest will be held occasionally for the best role-player. An award
will be given to the best role-player. Role-playing is difficult to be
taught in writing, so we will also guide you as time goes on. If you have
any questions about how to role-play, how to expand role-play, anything
about role-play, or anything else whatsoever, ask your role-playing
immortal.

 We are here to help you. If you need help in role-playing or anything
of the sort,  just speak up. Note the RP imm, talk to them, or talk to
any of the immortals. Role-playing is about acting, reacting, and most
importantly and to the point. Role-playing is about having fun.

Example:  PROMPT <%hhp %mm %vmv>
        Will set your prompt to "<10hp 100m 100mv>"
~
-1 MEMBER~
Syntax: member <char>          Invites or removes a member from your clan.
        member <accept|deny>   Accept or Deny an invitation to join a clan.

The first syntax of this command may only be used by the clan leader.
You may not invite a player who is already in another clan.

If you have been invited to join a clan, you may use the ACCEPT option
to actually become a member of that clan.  Use the DENY option if you
do not wish to join the clan in question.
~
0 COLOUR COLOR ANSI~
Syntax: colour              Toggles colour mode on/off
        colour list         Lists the available colours and channels
        colour #            Sets your default colour to #
        colour <channel> #  Sets the channel colour to #

Use the list option to view a list of all the channels you can set a color
for, along with the color numbers to use for channels and the default color.

Using a number as the only argument will set your default color to this
number. (Default color is the color most text is displayed in)

Using a channel name as the first argument and a number as the second argument
will set this channels color to the number. for example:
       colour gossip 13
This will change the gossip channel color from the default bright blue to
bright magenta.

You may also talk in colour; the format is like this: the 'escape character'
to specify a colour is the left handed brace '{{', following that you should
use one of the following numbers,

         {x{{0     reset, returns to default

         {r{{1     red     {m{{5     magenta
         {g{{2     green   {c{{6     cyan
         {y{{3     yellow  {w{{7     white
         {b{{4     blue    {D{{8     grey{x

For brighter colours, use the shifted numbers: {R!{G@{Y#{B${M%{C^{W&{x
When using colour, it looks better if you finish the line with whatever
colour it would normally be in, such as a gossip, the colour is magenta, so:
                {mLope gossips '{ghello,{r world{m'{x
        looks better than:
                {mLope gossips '{ghello,{r world'{x

Colour is courtesy of Lope from Loping Through The MUD.

152 POINTS~
When running quests and giving out prizes please follow these guidelines:

For easy quests give 2 QP MAX (that means max of TWO points should be
distributed during the quest. Either 2 to a winner or 1 to two people).
These are quests like trivia quests, kill an easy mob, easy find objects etc.

For mediocre quests -  3 IMM QP to the winner (no more than 2 to others. That
is max of FIVE points to be distributed during the quest)
Examples of mediocre quests: kill a hard mob, find things you spread around
the mud, etc.

For harder quests - 5 IMM QP to winner (discretionary to others)
These are quests that take days to plan or hours to play, quests that involve mass
dying, or require a deep knowledge of the mud, or that involve group participation.
Note: {1Winner of NO quest should receive more than 5 IMM QP{x and
	{1No more than 10 IMM QP are to be distributed in ANY quest{x
But keep in mind, 10 is the absolute MAX and should be VERY rare. Usual quests should include no more than
FIVE points total. These are guidelines for points only. Feel free to
supplement your point prizes by money, items, etc. Use discetion.

When people ask you to redeem their QP (according to the HELP QP):

Setting diceroll = increasing value v1 of the object by 1
Changing flags is done by (in case u didn't know) : flag obj <weapon name> weap
<flag name>
Restringing = please restring ALL THREE fields (short, long, name) Also, when
doing a restring for ANYONE, always include "restrung" in the name field.
i.e. for Kira's sword do : string obj sword name kira sword restrung

0 CONJURE~
Syntax: cast conjure

the effects of another use for 1 tick.

{RWARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING{x

own free will.  If you pick up your own voodoo doll, it will soon
vanish.
~

-1 GLADIATOR~
.{&Gladiator is the 2nd tier version of a Warrior, the most straight
forward and brutal of the classes.

Though Gladiators can use magic, the spell classes are very expensive
and spells take a lot of practices to learn.  Not to mention the mana
of a Gladiator is minimal.

A Gladiator's default weapon is a sword and other weapon skills are
easily obtained.  Gladiators also get bash, 2nd attack, scrolls,
staves and wands.

The Gladiator default group includes:

weapons master - the art of combat with all weapons
enhanced damage - increases the damage inflicted on opponents
Shield Block - The ability to let your shield take a hit for you
parry - the art of avoiding blows
rescue - save your allies from damage in battle
disarm - the ability to make your opponent lose their weapon
third attack - a 3rd hit in one round
fourth attack - a 4th hit in one round{x
~
-1 MERCENARY~
.{& Mercenaries are the 2nd tier version of thieves, the most deceptive
class in Thera.  They have fighting abilities comparable to Gladiatiors,
but still fall short.  They also have some magical abilities, but spell
classes are received at a high cost.  

Mercenaries have the natural ability to use daggers and to steal.

Mercenary default includes:
mace - the ability to fight with a mace, club or other blunt weapon
sword - the ability to fight with swords and sword type weapons

~
-1 STRIDER~
.{&Striders are the 2nd tier version of Rangers, masters of the hunt.
They have a blend of Gladiator and Sage skills with the ability to
Ambush.  Since they aren't as adept as warriors when it comes to
fighting and Sages when it comes to using magic, the skills and spells
tend to be expensive.  Striders naturally receive the ability to use a
dagger and also get second attack for nothing.  At level 50 or so they
receive the ability to levitate shields, freeing both hands for
weapons.  

Strider default includes:

weapons master - the art of combat with all weapons
parry - the art of avoiding blows  
envenom - the ability to poison a weapon or another item

-1 PRIEST~
.{%Priests are the 2nd tier version of Clerics, the masters of protective
and healing spells.  Priests are often coveted by groups for their
ability to heal others and themselves.  Priests are also fair in the
ways of fighting with weapons.  They can be impressive with attack
spells, but still don't match the ability of a Wizard.  Priests at
level 40 can levitate shields.

The default weapon for a Priest is a mace, and other weapon skills are
obtained at an expensive cost.  They naturally receive scrolls, wands
and staves.

Priest default includes:

~
-1 LICH~
.{&Liches are the 2nd tier answer to the vampire class, the undead
masters of mind control.  Liches hold the ability to drink blood to
revive themselves, thus not needing any kind of heal spells.  Vampires
are killers, though not as adept at sneaking as thieves, they are more
magical in nature and get spell classes relatively cheap.

Liches naturally have the ability to use daggers, sneak and hide

Lich default includes:

backstab - hitting your opponent by surprise

-1 SAGE~
.{&Sages are the 2nd tier version of Druids, masters of the elements. 
They have a good mix of healing, protective and attack spells, but
aren't quite as adept as Priests and Wizards at their respective
trades.  Sages are however better suited for combat than their fellow
magic users. Sages can also levitate Shields at level 65.

Sages naturally receive wands, scrolls and staves along with their
default weapon, polearm.  Other weapon skills are obtained at a very
reasonable cost.

Sage default includes:
attack - offensive spells
benedictions - employing the help of a deity to aid you
creation - the creation of physical objects such as food and water
combat - devastating offensive spells like acid blast and fire ball
curative - the ability to cure diseases, blindness and poison 
healing- spells that replenish health and movement 
protective - protective spells coupled with spells that dispel the magic on others
weather -elemental based attacks{x
~
-1 WIZARD~
.{&Wizards are the 2nd tier version of Mages, the masters of offensive,
illusion and enchantment magics.  Due to their bookish nature, Wizards
tend to be weak in the ways of weapon and hand to hand combat and
prefer to use their wit to win a battle. Wizards naturally get the
ability to levitate shields.

A Wizard's default weapon in a dagger and other weapon skills are
obtained at an expensive cost.  Wizards also naturally obtain scrolls,
staves and wands.

Wizard default includes:

Beguiling - mental attack spells
combat - devastating offensive spells like acid blast and fireball
detection - informational magic such as detect invis and locate object
enhancement - spells that enhance the body's natural abilities

-1 THERA STORY~
.{&In the beginning of the realm, there came a light in the vast darkness of
the condition known as existence.  The one known as F'nor came and claimed
the lands around as his own.  He was kind, and the light he brought was
very appreciated by the masses of people that had been living in darkness
for so long.  F'nor, and his dragon Canth, were Gods in the eyes of those
around.  But there was one who remembered the darkness.  One who found the
light to be oppressing, and not as benevolent as those around.  His heart
was as pitch, black and thick with hatred.  This one was Ezmeril.
     Ezmeril had seen how F'nor did his tricks and powers, and soon taught
himself to emulate those powers, although he could not match F'nor's power
in those skills.  He planned to overthrow F'nor and return the world into
the state of darkness it was before, the way he remembered and loved.
Unfortunately for Ezmeril, the people of the realm as a whole did not
wish to return to those days as he did.  A very few agreed with Ezmeril,
but most all sided with F'nor.  Ezmeril grew very angry, and took to very
violent acts and subterfuge to spread her ideas about the absence of
light.  She slandered the light, and spread lies saying it was evil, but
the people saw through his attempts at deception, and grew to hate him
even more.  Finally Ezmeril just threw herself totally against F'nor,
thinking that with F'nor out of the way, she would be able to rule
completely, and the people would grow to love her just as much as they now
loved F'nor.
     F'nor loved the people he had brought out of the darkness, and he
could not bring himself to stand by and watch this Ezmeril attack some of
these people just because they liked it better light.  F'nor decided that
even though he loved peace, this one must be pacified one way or the
other.  He tried to talk to this hater of light, but Ezmeril just threw
hate back in his face, and even tried to bring about F'nor's death, which
Canth saved him from.  So F'nor, under advice from some of his closest new
friends, decided that he had to fight back.
     There came a time one fine bright day, when Ezmeril just all out
attacked F'nor.  He did this in front of a multitude of people.  F'nor had
been advised to expect this by some who knew of Ezmeril before F'nor's
arrival, so he was fully ready.  F'nor had learned of Ezmeril's power and
made himself immune to that attack, and struck back at Ezmeril with a
fierce power of his own.  Ezmeril was caught totally unaware by the
ferocity of this attack by the normally peaceful F'nor.  F'nor totally
decimated Ezmeril that day, and Ezmeril, defeated soundly, retreated to
recover his wounds, and pride.
     F'nor knows that Ezmeril was not beaten permanently, as he was always
too tenacious in his hatred, but for the time being, Ezmeril has been
pacified.  There will most likely come a time when Ezmeril feels prepared
enough to strike again, but until that time, the Light reigns supreme,
and F'nor is still most loved by the people of the realm.{x

.{&   CHAOS stands for disorder and disarray. The believers in Chaos hold there
 is no preordained order or careful balance of forces in nature. Instead, we 
 see the universe as a collection of things and events, some relate to each 
other and others completely independent. Chaotic followers believe in the 
power of the individual over his/her own destiny though they also realize the
function of society in protecting their individual rights. We are neither good 
nor evil, but many view our actions as evil since our actions tend to go 
against the rules of society. We place our own needs and desires over those 
of society.

-1 GOLD SILVER MONEY~
Midgaard's economy is based on gold and silver coinage (and the lowly copper,
which you as an adventurer are far too proud to carry).  Gold coins are worth
100 silver coins, but are also four times as heavy (25 to the pound, as 
opposed to 100 to the pound for silver). Gems can be bought to alleviate weight problems
from the Midgaard jeweller, he charges a mere 10% more than they are worth.
10 gems weigh one pound, and they can be worth more than 100 gold pieces for
the highest quality stones.

~

0 DEATH~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the Altar of the Temple
of Midgaard.  Your corpse is left behind in the room where you were killed,
together with all of your equipment.

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.

Following and groups are not affected by death.

You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is two-thirds of 
the way back to the beginning of your level.

Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.
Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real time).
Only the player who died, or someone in the same group, can retrieve objects
from a player's corpse.

~



0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need a set 
amount of experience points for each level based on your creation points.

You gain experience by:

    being part of a group that kills a monster

You lose experience by:

    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of certain spells
    dying

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your alignment
versus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have been killed
lately; and some random variation.

0 COLOUR COLOR ANSI~
Syntax: colour        Toggles colour mode on/off

You may also talk in colour; the format is like this: the 'escape character'
to specify a colour is the left handed brace '{{', following that you should
use one of the following numbers,

         {x{{0     reset, returns to default

         {r{{1     red     {m{{5     magenta
         {g{{2     green   {c{{6     cyan
         {y{{3     yellow  {w{{7     white
         {b{{4     blue    {D{{8     grey{x

For brighter colours, use the shifted numbers: {R!{G@{Y#{B${M%{C^{W&{x
When using colour, it looks better if you finish the line with whatever
colour it would normally be in, such as a gossip, the colour is magenta, so:
                {mLope gossips '{ghello,{r world{m'{x
        looks better than:
                {mLope gossips '{ghello,{r world'{x

You may switch to the old format for flags (as used on other
muds) at any time with the 'long' command.
~

0 LONG~
The LONG command will affect the way you see special flags on other
characters and equipment.  With the long flag set, you will see the
flags much as you do on other muds, most of them as (Aura)'s.
Without the long flag (default), you will see any flags within
a much shorter table.  See 'HELP FLAGS' for the shorter tables.
~

0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.

0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells.

GOSSIP and CGOSSIP are variants of SHOUT (without the delay).
GOSSIP or IC will send the message to everyone listening, CGOSSIP or ICCLAN will send
only to those who are clanned.
'.' is a synonym for GOSSIP/IC.
'=' is a synonym for CGOSSIP/ICCLAN.

QGOSSIP sends a message to everyone with an IMMortal quest flag on during an
IMMortal quest.

ASK and ANSWER are channels that work together as a way for players to gain
information about the mud and to get help.

The AUCTION channel is for players to sell and buy valuables publicly.

OOC is the out of character channel.  This is the only channel where real life
emotions, feelings, and comments should be expressed.  Other channels are
considered in character and to be used to express the feelings, emotions, and
comments of your character regardless of real life situations.

GRATS is used for congratulating characters on accomplishments such as leveling,
heroing, etc.

The MUSIC channel is used for singing.  This is a global channel and can be heard all
over the mud.  (Please be on pitch)

QUOTE is a global channel used for quoting interesting comments.

YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.

CHANNELS shows you a list of the channels available to you and whether or not you have
them turned on or off.

PMOTE is similar to emote, but will substitute you and your for a target's
name (i.e. pmote bonks Alander will be read as bonks you by Alander, and
as bonks Alander by everyone else).

POSE produces a random message depending on your class and level.
~

152 SMOTE~
Syntax: smote <action>

Smote works exactly like pmote, except you must place your name somewhere in
the string, and it will show that string to everyone in the room.

~

0 BUY LIST SELL VALUE~
Syntax: buy   <object>
Syntax: list
Syntax: sell  <object>
Syntax: value <object>

BUY buys an object from a shop keeper.
When multiple items of the same name are listed, type 'buy n.item', where n
is the position of the item in a list of that name.  So if there are two
swords, buy 2.sword will buy the second. If you want to buy multiples of
an item, use an * (buy 5*pie will buy 5 pies).  These can be combined into
(for example) buy 2*2.shield, as long as the * is first.  

LIST lists the objects the shop keeper will sell you.
List <name> shows you only objects of that name.

SELL sells an object to a shop keeper.

VALUE asks the shop keeper how much he, she, or it will buy the item for.

default is 24 lines).  Change this to a higher number for larger screen
sizes, or to 0 to disabling paging.
~

0 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP~
Syntax: brandish
Syntax: quaff    <potion>
Syntax: recite   <scroll> <target>
Syntax: zap      <target>
Syntax: zap

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed
to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the
<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a
magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting
someone, then that character is used for a target.

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single
charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no
more charges, it will be consumed.

These commands may require an item skill to be successful, see the help entries
on the skills scrolls, staves, and wands for more information.
~

0 CONSIDER~
Syntax: consider <character>

CONSIDER tells you what your chances are of killing a character.
Of course, it's only a rough estimate.
~

0 FOLLOW GROUP NOFOLLOW~
Syntax: follow <character>
Syntax: group
Syntax: group <character>
Syntax: nofollow

FOLLOW starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone else,
just FOLLOW <yourself>.

NOFOLLOW toggles your ability to follow others or have anyone follow you.  It
also terminates any groups of which you are the leader.

GROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and
SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight.

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.

You may FOLLOW and GROUP only with characters who are within five levels of
your own.
~

0 VISIBLE~
VISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
making you visible again.
~

0 QUIT RENT SAVE~
Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: RENT ... not!
Syntax: SAVE

SAVE saves your character and object.  The game saves your character every
15 minutes regardless, and is the preferred method of saving.  Typing save
will block all other command for about 20 seconds, so use it sparingly.
(90+ players all typing save every 30 seconds just generated too much lag)

Some objects, such as keys and potions, may not be saved.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere.  When you re-enter the game 
you will be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

There is no RENT in this mud.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.
~

0 PUSH DRAG~
Syntax:  push <target>
Syntax:  drag <target>

PUSH allows you to push a {Rviolent player{x from the room in which he/she/it is
standing.

DRAG is similar to PUSH except you go with the person.

Success of PUSH and DRAG depend upon your size versus your targets as well as
the amount of hitpts you both have.

Note:  Both you and the target must be flagged {Rviolent{x.
~

offerings at the chapel of the god whose alignment you wish to be.  Both chapels
are located in Midgaard and are on the Map of Midgaard.
~

0 RECALL /~
Syntax: RECALL

RECALL prays to your god for miraculous transportation from where you are
back to the Temple of Midgaard.  '/' is a synonym for RECALL.
If you are a member of a clan that has it's own reincarnation room,
your god will transport you there, unless you have been labeled a thief
or killer.

If you RECALL during combat, you will lose experience (more than for fleeing),
and you will have a chance of failing (again, more than for fleeing).  This
chance is based on your recall skill, although a 100% recall does not 
insure success.

RECALL costs 1/4 of your movement points.

RECALL doesn't work in certain god-forsaken rooms.  Characters afflicted by a
curse may not recall at all.
~

-1 SPLIT~
Syntax: SPLIT <silver> <gold>

SPLIT splits some coins  between you and all the members of your
group who are in the same room as you.  It's customary to SPLIT
the loot after a kill.  The first argument is the amount of silver
the split (0 is acceptable), and the second gold (optional).
Examples:
split 30 	--> split 30 silver
split 20 50	--> split 20 silver, 50 gold
split  0 10	--> split 10 gold
~

0 STEAL~
Syntax: STEAL coins <character>
Syntax: STEAL <object> <character>

STEAL attempts to steal coins, or an object, from a character.

In order to STEAL successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.
~

0 PRACTICE~
Syntax: PRACTICE
Syntax: PRACTICE <skill|spell>

PRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in all
the skills and spells available to you.  You can check this anywhere.

PRACTICE with an argument practice that skill or spell.  Your learning
percentage varies from 0% (unlearned) to a some maximum between 80% and 100%,
depending on your class.  You must be at a guild master to practice.

The higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice
session.  The higher your wisdom, the more practice sessions you will
have each time you gain a level.  Unused sessions are saved until you
do use them.
~

0 TRAIN~
Syntax: train <str int wis dex con hp mana>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class, and several
initial training sessions.  You can increase your attributes by
using these sessions at a trainer (there are several in town).

It takes one training session to improve an attribute, or to increase
mana or hp by 10.  You receive one session per level.

The best attributes to train first are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more
practice when you gain a level.  CON gives you more hit points.
In the long run, your character will be most powerful if you train
WIS and CON both to 18 before practicing or training anything else.
~

160 ADVANCE~
Syntax: advance <character> <level>

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.
~

160 TRUST~
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
~

159 ALLOW BAN PERMBAN~
Syntax: allow   <site>
	ban     <site> <newbies|all|permit>
	ban

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from
the ban list, if the remover is of equal or higher level than the banner.

A site may have all players, new players, or non-permitted players (set
by editing the player file) banned, by changing the argument after the site.
*s may be used to ban either by suffix (*.edu), prefix (labmac*), or 
content (*andrews*), but be careful not to accidentally lock out too many
sites with a wildcard.  Bans do not save unless the permban command is used.
~

159 REBOOT SHUTDOWN~
Syntax: reboot
	shutdown

Reboot shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of fifteen seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

Shutdown shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.
~


159 WIZLOCK NEWLOCK~
Syntax: wizlock
	newlock

Wizlock and newlock both block login attempts to ROT. Wizlock locks
out all non-gods (i.e. level less than 101), except for link-dead players who
are returning.  Newlock only locks out new character generation, typically
used for preventing a spammer from returning.  Wizlocking should be avoided,
and newlocking should be accompanied by mail or a note to the imps.

A god must be at least Supreme level to wizlock the game.
~

159 DENY ERASE~
Syntax: deny <name>
        erase <name>

DENY and ERASE lock a character out of a game permanently, rendering their
character name unusable.  They may only be removed by editing the pfile, for
this reason freeze is usually preferred.

If a player is DENY'd, they will be sent a message telling them so, then
will be forced to quit.  They will then receive a message telling them
they are denied access any time they try to connect.

If a player is ERASED, they will receive no message, and will be immediately
disconnected.  They will immediately be disconnected any time they attempt
to connect, with no explanation.
~

157 DISCONNECT~
Syntax: disconnect <name>

Disconnect breaks a player's link to the game, dumping them back to the telnet
prompt.  This is a non-lethal way of getting rid of spammers and annoying
players.
~

156 FREEZE~
Syntax: freeze <name>

FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all. It can be removed from within the game, so freezing a 
troublemaker is usually a better option than they deny command.
~

159 DUPE~
Syntax: dupe <character> <name>

DUPE will add or remove a dupe account name to a list kept on the players
account.  Anytime this player connects, all characters on their dupe list
will be forced to quit (except immortals).  This should be used only on
those who flagrantly violate the rule against bringing in more than one
character at a time and using one character to build a second.  Entering
a dupe that is already on the list will cause it to be removed.

Using DUPE <character> without the second argument will list that
characters current dupes.
~

152 MQUEST~
Syntax: mquest <object>

MQUEST sets or removes the quest flag on any object.  A mortal character
may only carry ONE item with the quest flag set.
~

153 FORCE~
Syntax: force <character> <command>
Syntax: force all <command>

FORCE forces one character to execute a command, except of course delete.

Below level 107 (Deity) force can only be used on mobiles, and force all is
unavailable.  You also cannot 'force orc murder hugo', for example. 

FORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command.
This is typically used for 'force all save'.
~

152 SOCKETS~
Syntax: sockets
	sockets <name> 

SOCKETS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including 
users in the process of logging in.  The two numbers inside brackets are the 
channel number and the 'connected' state.  The 'connected' states are listed in 
merc.h: 0 is CON_PLAYING; non-zero values are various states of logging in.

The optional name argument shows the site of a player, or optional can be used
to identify switched gods (i.e. socket orc shows the name of anyone switched
into an orc).
~

154 LOAD~
Syntax: load mob <vnum>
	load obj <vnum> <level>

The load command is used to load new objects or mobiles (use clone to 
duplicate strung items and mobs).  The vnums can be found with the vnum
command, or by stat'ing an existing mob or object.

Load puts objects in inventory if they can be carried, otherwise they are
put in the room.  Mobiles are always put into the same room as the god. Old
format objects must be given a level argument to determine their power, new
format objects have a preset level that cannot be changed without set.
(see also clone, vnum, stat)
~

159 SET~
Syntax: set mob   <mobile> <field> <value>
	set obj   <object> <field> <value>
	set room  <number> <field> <value>
	set skill <char>   <name>  <rating>
	set skill <char>   all     <rating>

The set command is used to change the numerical values of the various data
structures. Type set <class> without an argument to see a listing of options.
Set skill all (pc's only) will set all the character's skills to the value
given.  Use string to change the strings on an object or mobile.
(see also string, stat)

~

154 STRING~
Syntax: string obj <field> <string>
	string mob <field> <string>

The string command changes the various strings associated with an object or
mobile.  A full list of fields can be viewed by typing string obj or string
mob.  Sorry, multi-line strings are not yet supported.
~

155 NOCHANNEL NOCLAN NOEMOTE NORESTORE NOSHOUT NOTELL NOTITLE~
Syntax: nochannel <character>
	noclan    <character>
	noemote   <character>
	norestore <character>
	noshout   <character>
	notell    <character>
	notitle   <character>

NOEMOTE, NOSHOUT, and NOTELL are used to muffle other characters, by
preventing them from emoting, shouting, and telling, respectively.
Characters who are noshout'ed or no'telled will also not receive those
forms of communication.

The NOCHANNEL command is similar, but more drastic. It prevents the victim
from using any of the channels (gossip, cgossip, Q/A, music) on the game.
Nochannels usually result from swearing or spamming on public channels.

The NORESTORE command makes a player immune to the restore command.
This is used to punish players who constantly ask for restores from
immortals.

The NOCLAN command makes a player unable to join pkill-type clans.
This is used to punish players who are known to cause serious troubles
with pkilling.

The NOTITLE command makes a player unable to set their own title.
This is used to punish players who use the title for swearing,
threats, etc....
~

153 TWIT PARDON~
Syntax: twit   <character>
        pardon <character>

TWIT sets the Twit flag on a player.  When set, the twit flag causes
any mobiles in a LAW room (all of Midgaard) to attack the player,
and the shopkeepers will not sell to the player.  Also, any player may
attack and kill a player with the twit flag, whether they can normally
pkill or not.

PARDON will remove the Twit flag if set.
~

152 PURGE~
Syntax: purge
	purge <character>

Purge is used to clean up the world.  Purge with no arguments removes all the
NPC's and objects in the current room.  Purge with an argument purges one
character from anywhere in the world.

Purge will not get rid of PC's, or objects or mobiles with a NOPURGE flag
set (i.e. the pit, the fountain, shopkeepers, Hassan).  Mobiles may be
purged if they are called directly by name.
~

159 RESTORE~
Syntax: restore <character>
	restore room
	restore all

Restore restores full hit points, mana points, and movement points to the
target character.  It also heals poison, plague, and blindness.

Restore room (or restore with no argument) performs a restore on every player
in the room, restore all does the same for all connected players. Restore all
is only usable by creators and implementors.  Restore should be used sparingly
or not at all.
~

157 SLAY~
Syntax: slay <character>

Slay kills a character in cold blood, no saving throw.  Best not to use this
command on players if you enjoy being a god.  Any God level 108 or below 
attempting to use the slay Command gets killed themselves due to a bug.
~

154 TRANSFER TELEPORT~
Syntax: transfer <character>
	transfer all
	transfer <character> <location>
	transfer all         <location>

Transfer transfers the target character, or ALL player characters,
to your current location (default) or to a specified location. Trans all 
should almost never be used, as 100 players popping into one room can have
horrible effects on slow links. Teleport is a synonym for transfer. 
~

152 RECOVER~
Syntax: recover <character>

Recover transfers the target character to their default recall point.
You may only recover a character who is either cursed, or is stuck in
a no-recall area.
~

154 AT~
Syntax: at <location> <command>

At executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given
location.  The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of
a mobile, or as the name of an object.

At works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the
command, and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your
location).
~

152 ECHO GECHO PECHO~
Syntax: echo  <message>
	gecho <message>
	pecho <character> <message>

These commands all perform similar functions.  Echo sends the message to
all characters in the same room as the user, with no indication of who sent
it.  Gecho does the same for all players connected to the game, and pecho
sends the message to the player specified as the target.  Any higher-level
god will see a prompt in front of your message, informing him or her that it
is an echo.
~

152 GOTO~
Syntax: goto
        goto <location>

Goto takes you to a location.  The location may be specified as a vnum,
as the name of a mobile, or as the name of an object.

Goto with no argument will take you to your default location if you
have one set. (see GSET)  If used in this manner, your pet will be
transferred with you.

You may not Goto a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters
already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters
already present. Some other rooms are barred to players below a certain
god level.

Implementors can use the violate command to get into private rooms.

Gset allows you to set the default location for the goto command to
take you to.
~

152 HOLYLIGHT INVIS WIZINVIS~
Syntax: holylight
	wiznvis <level>

Holylight is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

Wizinvis takes a level argument, and will make you invisible to all players of
a lower level than your invisibility level.  It defaults to the maximum
(your level) if no argument is given.  Wizi 160 characters are totally 
invisible.
~

152 INCOGNITO GHOST~
Toggling your incognito status will hide your presence from people outside the
room you are in, but leave you visible to those who are with you.
Toggling your ghost status will do the exact opposite, making you invisible
to anyone in the same room as you, but visible to those outside the room.
While ghost is set, you will still appear visible to all characters in the
game through the 'who' command. (depending on your wizinv level)
Both take a level argument similar to wizinvis, people at that level
or higher can see you regardless of location.
These flags are mutually exclusive, turning on one will automatically turn
the other off.
~

160 MEMORY~
Syntax: memory

Memory reports the size of your mud.

The 'Mobs' and 'Objs' lines report the number of types of mobiles and objects,
not the number of instances currently in the game.

a maximum limit, which is also shown.

on the number and size of these blocks.
~

152 VNUM~
Syntax: vnum <name>

the results.  Use vnum obj or vnum mob to limit the search.  This vnum is
very useful for loading. Vnum skill returns the skill number (for set) and
the slot number (for making new zones) of a skill name. Vnum area lists
all areas and their range of vnums.
(see also load)
~

152 STAT~
Syntax: stat <name>
	stat mob  <name>
	stat obj  <name>
	stat room <number>

The stat command gives you detailed information on an object, mobile, or room
within the game.  Without a class argument, the command will return a object
(if found), a mobile (if no object exists, but a mobile does), or a room 
(if a number is  given).  Stat room with no argument stats the room you are
standing in.  Stat can be used to find room vnums for goto.
(see also goto, transfer)
~

~

'leaves in a swirling mist'.  You can replace these messages with messages of
your own choosing using the poofin and poofout commands.  These messages
must include your name somewhere in the string.

Poofin and poofout only show to characters who can see you.
(see also goto)
~

161 PROTECT~
Syntax: protect <character>

Protect is used to protect a character from unwanted snooping.  Removing 
protected status from a character WILL be seen by that character.
~

159 LOG SNOOP~
Syntax: log   <character>
	log   all
	snoop <character>

Log <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like Freeze, it is a permanent character toggle.
Logs may only be used by creators and implementors, and should be accompanied
by mail to the implementors.

Certain commands (Password) are protected against log.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

Log all logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots. Please do not use this unless you tell the imps.

Snoop shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time. Try to respect privacy.

Snoop yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.
~

153 SWITCH RETURN~
Syntax: switch <character>

already have a descriptor, e.g. you can't switch into a PC). You also cannot
switch into link-dead PCs.

the wiznetted immortal.  Wiznet by itself turns wiznet on and off, 
wiznet show lists all settable flags (they are not detailed here), 
wiznet status shows your current wiznet settings, and wiznet <field> toggles
a field on and off.  The events should be self-explanatory, if they are not,
fiddle with them a while.  More events are available at higher levels.

{xSyntax: {Gsskill{g           (to see your proficiency in it)
{xSyntax: {Gstance{g           (to relax the stance){x

In combat, the stance of the fighter plays a very important role; you 
can't just stand there and exchange blow for blow unless you are very 
confident of your ability.  Each fighting stance has advantages and 
disadvantages, the basic outline of which follows:

{GVIPER : {gA very fast and aggressive style of combat, concentrating 
{g        on striking your opponent before they have the chance to 
{g        avoid or block you.
{GCRANE : {gA wide, sweeping style of combat, which concentrates on a 
{g        very strong blocking defence.
{GCRAB :  {gA low, defensive fighting stance which uses agile footwork 
{g        and rolling with attacks in order to reduce your injuries.
{GMONGOOSE: {gA light-footed stance which relies on leaps and acrobatics 
{g          to ensure that by the time your opponent makes their 
{g          attack, you've moved out of the way.
{GBULL :  {gA low aggressive stance which concentrates purely on 
{g        physical power.

{xOnce you are in a stance, you can type '{Gsskill{x' to see how skilled
you are in that particular stance and what your percentage is.  This 
only works when you are in that stance.

{xSee also helps on 'advancedstance' and 'stancetable'.
