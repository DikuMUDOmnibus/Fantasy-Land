The Lair of the Demonic Dragon~
The walls in this room have a brilliant red color to them.  At first you 
don't realize what this is from, but as you focus more clearly you see that 
the red on the walls is actually blood.  While your attention is distracted 
at the brilliant glow of the walls you hear something making a slight movement
You now realize that this is the home of the Demonic Dragon.
