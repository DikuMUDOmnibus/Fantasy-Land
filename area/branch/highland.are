warrior's birthplace when the warrior dies away from home.  Flashing you
an enigmatic smile he offers to take YOU home.  All you need to do is
die first!

his waist. Legend has it that he is 7 ft tall, shoots lightning bolts
from his eyes and consumes the enemies with fireballs from his arse. His
smile is from the angels themselves.

Bonnie Banks O' Loch Lomond~
The surrounding upward slopes known as braes are green and the muirs that
some call moors are carpeted lushly with heather.  The wild cry of the loon
echoes a wistful refrain strangely out of keeping in this peaceful scene.
Thither and yon you see a hale gilly-fish ripple the cobalt waters of this
pristine very deep loch.  In the distance you hear the poignant strains of
the bagpipes.  Near the banks you see the ghosts of a braw warrior and his
lass wrapped in the arms of true luve.  'Tis said he was brought here via
the Low Road at the speed of Death.

You brush aside the shrub-elder branches as you head deeper towards the

hue than the sky itself bloom in sequestered clumps along the way.  To one
side you see a dense thicket patch.  Something or someone has startled the
brown hare who almost hops right on your feet as it dashes by you.  The path

Cairn Tunnel~
As you wander farther into the cave you almost stumble on a neatly piled
stack of rocks known as a cairn.  The ground is a wee bit damper here and
the distant sounds of an underground stream pique your curiosity.  Someone
has left a large metal horse-shoe to the side of the cairn.  Perhaps ye
might want to look at it more closely.

horse-shoe~
In Scotland, the horse-shoe is not so much a bringer of luck as a
keeper-away of evil.  And here is how it obtained the power to keep off
witches, bogles and all other imps of the Devil.  Once upon a time, the
Devil pulled from his bed at midnight a smith in Lochaber, for badly his
hooves needing shoeing.  The smith, annoyed and frightened, but having the
Devil in his power, not only burned the horn of the hoof he was shoeing, but
the fleshy part, too!  While driving in the first nail, the smith
deliberately hammered it into the flesh.  The Devil screamed in agony, and
hpped round the smithy on one unshod foot.  He howled for the man to tear
out the nail and to shoe him properly, but the smith refused until the Devil
was willing to promise him anything.  And the promise the man extracted was,
that wherever a horseshoe lay or hung no evil thing could pass.  And the
Devil, perforce, had to agree.

A silver linn of icy-cold fresh spring water cascades over the step-stone
roughened side of the cavern.  The misty spray from the linn touches your
face causing you to shiver slightly.  Some of the water forms a wee pool in
a naturally made trough.  The rest of it rushes off via a very small opening
at the far cave wall.  It doesn't look as if a man could fit through that
opening.  This part of the cave ends abruptly here though you do notice

King's Keep~
The floor in here has been strewn with a sweet smelling hay.  The King
offers a lump of sugar to his honey-coloured Shetland pony.  You see various
battleplans scattered about on a table in the room.  A gilded throne nearby
is carved with a pattern of honeybees and heather bells.  Seeing you the
King says, "My son ye maun kill, before ye I will tell how we brew the yill
from the heather bell!"  You hear sounds of activity from a room to the east.

Fugitive's Hideout~
Where you confront your foes, I now turn and have to flee. I am too weak
to make heroic stand. My hope is to escape, and so I slip from cave to
cave across the darkening land. No one will tell of my heroic death.
My strategy is to elude and live. When Fortune smiles again, I will return
and rule again. I am the fugitive.

Thistle Lair~
You quietly climb down the rough-hewn ladder and gratefully land with a
soft thump.  The quiet seclusion and semi-darkness in here gives a feeling
of safeness which hopefully is not just an illusion.  A number of open
crates, filled with supplies, are stacked around the cave room.  In one
crate you see extra dirks and fresh quivers of arrows.  Another crate bears
waterskins, cloth bandages and medicinal herbs.  Salted fish, dried nuts and
fruits as well as oatcakes are in a third crate.  Upon closer inspection you
find what appears to be a sleeping area nestled behind some of the crates.
There is even a tartan blanket spread out to keep a body warm.  How would a

MacBean is being proudly told.  Seems this clan hero held the gap at the

with a considerable number of the enemy.  Several large Scottish deerhounds

which tumbles a cool, refreshing burn or stream.  Hares run through the wild
myrtle and ferns growing along this gully.  The wind ripples through the red
hawthorne trees and sweeps past the pines and the yews.  The air is perfumed
by gowans, gillyflowers, pink azaleas and bluebells.  Hills surround three
sides of the horseshoe.  If there is an exit out it is so well hidden ye
