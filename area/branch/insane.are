Hallway~
The hallway is white and sterile.  Moans and strange noises come
from everywhere.  You wonder what brought so many people to this place.
Hospital personnel hustle up and down the hall with charts and
medications.  A few patients are wandering around in the hall,
their eyes vacant, their feet shuffling along on the floor as they
wonder around.

Treatment Holding Area~
This room is very plain.  A simple white room with chairs lining
the walls.  Several patients wait here for their turns, but for what
you don't know!  A receptionist motions for you to take a seat with
the other patients.  She taps her pencil on the desk and seems to
get very irritated when you don't sit down!  She motions to the orderly
in the corner and points to you!
