Article I: We shall at no time cause any player to die by our direct Actions,
and no destructive joke of any kind is allowed to be played against those 
under level 25.

Article II: We shall not interfere with Player Kills. This includes those in 
our clan who has been twitted.

Article III: Loyalty to the clan is not asked for, but demanded. If a person 
of higher rank than you asks for help, which does not break any rules, either
Jester or Global rules, you must aid them. There are two exceptions to this
rule: If you are on a quest, in which case you must help them after the quest
is finished, and if you are in the middle of battle, in which case you must 
help them after the battle is finished.

Article IV: Theft is NOT funny. Thieving from characters is {YPROHIBITED.{x 
Keep this in mind: If it's on them, it's theirs. If it's on the ground, it's 
yours.

Article V: Clan eq is to be donated to the clan trunk or sacrificed if not 
needed.

Article VI: Any method can be used to play jokes. This includes restrung eq, 
transportation, sneaking, being invisible, etc.

Article VII: Donations to the clan will be given to clan leaders ONLY. If you 
have money or gems that were given to you for the clan, you must give them to 
a clan leader as soon as possible. No clan leader may use clan funds for 
anything but the clan. If a clan leader is found to be embezzling, he will be 
{RIMMEDIATELY declanned{x and a hunt called for.

Article VIII: Members may offer their services for entertainment to any other
player. Any money made from these transactions is to be kept by the performer
and no part of it is required to be given to the clan.

Article IX: On the matter of hunts: Hunts are called only by the {&Leaders{x
of Jester, and every member of Jester may participate. A hunt target is to be
harassed by members of Jester until the hunt is over.

Article X: Any member of Jester who does NOT have fun will be asked to cheer up.

are unable to do so, contact a leader.

Amendment IV: Do not take life too seriously and most of all enjoy it.

Amendment V: If a leader is not abiding by the constitution or not doing any-
thing for the clan it is not only our right but it is our duty to impeach him
or her or it.

Amendment VI: You must try to your fullest capability of helping a fellow 
member if they ask for it.Amendment VII: If you have a good idea for the clan,
it is your duty to let your leaders know.

casting change sex on every person you see is not a joke, in fact it 
isn't even funny. Put some thought into your pranks.

The Clan Hall and Main Stage~
In this room, thousands of people have come to hear the best jokes of our
age mutilated by amatures, past off as original by the average, and made
to circulate by the greats, such as Robin Williams, John Candy, and
others. Along the back wall, you see the portraits of great slap-stick and
comedy performers such as Jackie Gleason, Red Skelton, Danny Kaye and
teams such as Abbot and Costello, The Marx Brothers, and the Three
Stooges. On one wall, there are four portraits of the founders: 
{$Leaper, the Laughing King of Jesters, Melmar, the Mystic Queen, 
Kitsune, the Silly Fox Spirit{x.
There is a stage here with an open mike for anyone who wants to try their
hand at standup.

handing out drinks and advice to the aspiring jokesters who are trying to
drown their sorrows in root beer. The bar is of beautiful mahogany, and is
well stocked with various sodas and a several types of liquer. Behind the
bartender, you see a huge metallic cannon in a case on a high shelf. You

As you walk in, you see some odd ornaments on your left, and the sleeping
impliment on the right.  Straight ahead you see videogame posters: Final
Fantasy, Breath of Fire, even Parappa the Rapper.  As you look closer, you
notice that Mario is no where up there.  On the left wall, above the
portals, you see Rogue Squadron, Zelda and much more.  The more you look,
the more you wonder about these Jesters.  The passageway south leads back to
the Jester's clan hall.
