You are brought to the Jesters Lounge, a place for rest and relaxation! 
Even the best need a break from the constant trickery and joking around. 
Pull up a chair and rest for awhile, although there is no gurantee that
there isn't a whoopie cushion in your seat somewhere.

Before you is a hallway in the grand clan hall of the Jesters.  A purple
lion lies abandoned in the corner of the room.  On a happier note you see a
huge {YN{GE{YO{GN{x sign welcoming you to Jesters.

You found your way into your own room!  Good for you, you see a few
multi-colored cots packed tightly into the small room.  There isn't alot of
room but somehow you feel at home.  A roaring fire warms you as you rest
your weary bones.  On the other side of the room a coat rack awaits your
coats, as you sit here looking at it you realize the coat rack has teeth.. 
Why does it have teeth you wonder...

In the middle of the room a large painting covers the floor drawing your
attention to it, upon investigation you realize it's a portal filled with
swords, armor, teddy bears and a sock?!  Upon closer inspection you find a
note that reads "Thank you for your donation please put something in the
painting the vacuums and mops are on strike so we would appreciate your part
in helping keep our clan hall clean!  Remember to use trickery every day, a
healthy Jester is a fun Jester!!!

A gigantic obsidian door with a black key hole has a scary essense to it
and makes you want to look away.  Above the door frame a sign reads Jotvers
lair.  To the east you see a bubble floating near the only door which seems
to be changing colors the sign reads "Meraevols secret hidey hole", there
doesn't seem to be a keyhole anywhere.  Muffled laughter comes from the west
where you see a lovely white door, above the door frame a golden sign reads
"Dorisu's room".  All that's left is the way you came, the south seems
normal enough.

You have entered meraevol's bedroom, on the far wall you see a lovely
window over looking the ocean.  The window is slightly open and you can
smell the ocean air and hear the waves.  Under the window you see a huge
square of layered rainbow jello with a fluffy comforter made of red cotton
candy and a marshmellow pillow.  The floor is littered with tons of multi-
colored jelly beans that seem to be hopping around madly, little wispy
{cb{wu{cb{wb{wl{ce{ws{x float around the room tickling your nose.

Upon opening the door, scents of citrus and honeysuckle waft past.  The
walls are a deep coffee color, with {!m{@u{#l{$t{%i{x-{!c{@o{#l{$o{%r{^e{&d{x glass and copper lanterns
casting flickering rainbows over everything.  Huge feather pillows are piled
in the corners of the room for guests to sit on, with an ancient looking
silver tea pot steaming slightly on a table in the middle of the room.  A
four-post bed can be almost seen behind a giant screen covered with albino
peacocks and lush jungle scenery.  A tall window with gauzy {^teal{x drapery
opens to the west with a view of a beautiful oasis at sunset.

As you enter the hallway to the healers room's you stop suddenly, as you
realize its raining cubed jello in every flavor!  Now in cake flavor!  You
wade through the fast growing mounds of jello and make your way through the
sticky mess bleeding no doubt almost there!  For some reason the jello is
soothing and that is scary although it is jello.
