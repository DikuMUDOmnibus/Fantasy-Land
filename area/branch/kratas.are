A Road Headed East~
The freezing chill has overwhelmed you making you shiver and your jaws
jitter.  The snowy covered path suddenly heads east as huge ridged mountains
are foreseeable over there covered with the whitest of snow.  Another path
heads to the north as well.  A freshly made snowy path takes you to a huge
icy trail to the south.

The Ice-Covered Road~
A strange sensation of sorts brews from the south.  In the view, a
strange invisble aura forms headed in that direction.  The cold chill out in
the open plains here stretch across the lands beyond providing no sense of
relief detectable anywhere towards the west or east.

The Ice-Covered Road~
Heavier packs of fresh snow begin to falter into the path travelling
north and south here.  New forms of ice begin to dampen and slicken the
footsteps as the cold unbearably overwhelms.  A magnificent castle hangs
high to the south above you.

The Heavy Snowy Road~
The frigid air has now hit these realms with a pounding wack as ice
begins to form on your weapon and armor.  Your waterskin has frozen solid
and now you begin to stagger about here.  The tall castle looms but seems so
close as you near it more and more.

The rampant winds and the downpour of snow is drenching the road you walk
on.  Your footwear has been covered with the height of massive snow as the
wind picks up freezing you to the bone.  Your heart begins to shiver in a

A Snow Covered Road~
The gray skies begin to darken as the famishing cold weather has made
visibility difficult.  The freezing climate has made this deserted snowy
land an unsafe place to travel as you move about in this north-south snowy
road.  The huge castle looms high above you as you near it to the south.

A Snow Covered Road~
As the grand Glacier Temple stands along the eastern territory, the
amount of snow grounded around is fresh and white as clouds.  Not much can
be seen as you scan across the northern and western portions.  A sign stands
on the western offside of the trail as it turns and heads southward.  A
small rabbit suddenly scampers by you disappearing in the thick snow.

Kratas' Office~
This is where Kratas handles state business.  You wonder by the looks of
the temple and the palace, just how well matters are handled.  There is a
large desk and a chair in the center of the room.

The Altar of Healing~
Holy candles fill the outer portions of this room as the smell of incense
odorizes the altar here.  Mists of smoke float above you as a huge marble
table stands at the center part of this room for those to offer sacrifices
and to restore themselves here in resting.  The outer units of the temple
lies to the north.  A huge unknown statue stands against the southern wall
here preventing anyone to exit the altar in that direction.

Walking Along A Snowy Road~
The long snowy path moves from the west and east here.  Nothing but white
snow is all you can see from miles around.  A huge curious structured castle
can be seen from the far north while huge mountains begin to grow the more
further east you go.  A turn in the road can be seen to the west.

Approaching the Snowy Mountains~
The frozen mountains now hover above you as several mounds of snow begin
to disattach from the mountain rocks causing a small avalanche of sorts.
Lookout!  Looking high above this amazing sight, you detect signs of
wildlife within these rocks wondering if you could climb it.  The snowy path
here moves closer to the base of the mountain to the east.  A path to the
west takes you into the open snowy fields.

A Dead End at the Base of the Snowy Mountain~
You find yourself at the lowest point of mountain where way up high..  It
carries about a couple thousand feet upwards.  The pathway ends here where a
small opening lies visible to the east.  Strange noises seem to brew from
inside but you wonder.  The only exit is west.  A strange SIGN is posted
here.
