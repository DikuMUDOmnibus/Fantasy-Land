Outside the Forests of Xanth~
You are south of the forests of middle Xanth.  The air here is bright and
the sun shines down on you in warmth, bringing an aura of happiness to you. 
To the south lies the outskirts of the Gap Chasm.  To the north lies the
dangers of the forest.

You are standing at the brink of the might Gap Chasm.  Below you lies a
barely manageable path down through the chasm.  It looks like a very
difficult path, threaded loosely with rough handholds and footholds, but
perhaps with your great dexterity, you may be able to make it.  The northern
brink of the Gap Chasm stretches to the west and east from here.

fireplace visible from the windows here, and the smell of food cooking makes
you hungry.  Perhaps you should go in and ask for food and lodging in

Inside the Farmhouse~
You are inside a small farmhouse near the Gap Chasm.  The small three
member family that resides in here has agreed to let you stay the night, and
you feel safe and warm in here.  The house is rather simple, filled with
objects that are much more practical than ornamental, showing that these
simple people live more by sense than by show.

Inside the Farmhouse~
You are inside the dining room of a small farmhouse near the Gap Chasm. 
The fireplace here lights the room with a soft orange-yellow glow and fills
the farmhouse with warmth.  The smell of a meaty stew simmering in a pot
sets your stomach off in convulsions of hunger.  Although not rich in your
normal socio-cultural viewpoint, these people are rich in the things they
need to survive, and can do so without the boundaries of image-conscious
society.

The Gap Chasm~
You are on the bottom of the Gap Chasm.  The floor here is rocky and
bare, providing a somewhat flat footing surface.  As you gaze about
yourself, all you see are the high canyon walls to the north and south, and
the level bottom stretching from east to west.  You had better get out of
here soon, unless you want to meet the Gap Dragon!  You are on the bottom of

The Tiny Cave~
You have discovered a tiny cave deep inside the Gap Chasm.  It is dark
here, and slightly muddy.  The darkness feels rather nice, after the
scorching heat of climbing the Gap Chasm, and you a tempted to stay here
awhile and regain your strength.  Then you notice something in the shadows
moving closer to you.

The Zombie Graveyard~
You have stumbled upon a large graveyard.  Looking about yourself with
caution, you notice that a large number of these graves have been dug out,
some graves looking as if they have been unearthed ages ago, some looking
unearthed only a few days ago.  Examining the graves closer, it seems as if
these graves were dug out from the inside...

The Gentle Forest~
You are in the middle forests of Xanth.  In this spot of the forest,
large ferns grow wild all about you, lending this area a feeling of peace
and serenity.  The trees here are large and stately, unlike the twisted and
somewhat sinister trees that occupy the rest of the forest.  The light
shines down softly upon you, and you wonder what has caused the wilderness
here to become tamer and more friendly.

You are standing before the shore of a large lake.  The lake is large and
inviting, the reflection of the trees and the large white clouds overhead
making this a very picturesque scene.  Dipping a toe into the lake, the
water feels cool and soothing and you are suddenly remind that the last time
you had a bath seems like ages ago.

populated by a number of mermaids and tritons, who playfully splash water at
you as you swim near.  The water is refeshingly cool against your skin, and

skin.

mermaids and tritons with glee.  You feel young and alive as the cool water
refreshes you.  The bottom of this lake is deep, and the water plants make
it hard for you to see the bottom.  As something touches your foot, you
giggling, then wonder why it is that none of the mermaids and tritons are
laughing anymore.

You are under the lake in the middle of Xanth.  Unfortunately, this is
the lair of a giant kraken, which reaches out for you hungrily.  The
darkness of the water makes it hard to tell which direction to flee, and you
wonder if you should attempt to fight the kraken in its home environment. 
The decision is made for you as you entangles your limbs and draw you
further into the water.

You are in a large field of grass.  Weary from your adventures, you
surmise that this would be a nice place to rest.  You lie down and fall
asleep for a few hours.  But when you wake you, you find that you are
anchored to the ground by the grass itself, which has grown tendril of grass
into your flesh!  This is no ordinary patch of grass it seems, but rather a
patch of carnivorous grass.

You are exploring off the enchanted path deep within Xanth.  In this
section of land, the ground looks rather scorched and all the vegetation has
been ripped to shreds.  Taking a closer look, you see that the other plants
have actually been ravaged by another type of plant enhanced with sharp
teeth.  Surprised, you take another glance around before realizing that you
have entered a snapdragon grove!

the vicious plants.  You attempt to uproot a few of the snapdragons and
almost lose a finger in the process.  Perhaps you should just move along and
get out of reach of these fierce flora.

clearing is filled with the gnawed bones of many countless victims who have
wandered here.  Pieces of savaged armor lie scattered about the room, red
with rust and dried blood.  Weapons, broken and shattered, are laying in a
heap near the center of the room.  You shiver as you imagine the power this
plant must have.

the ground, tangling your feet.  They completely fill you view, making you
feel lost and dizzy as you enter the midst of the vineyard.  To the south
you can make out a small mountain of some type.

into the sky, its sharp spire pointing up directly at the sun.  The rough
rock it is made up of offers convenient handholds for you to climb up upon,
but the large black burnstreaks that cover the mountain make you pause and
wonder if you SHOULD climb up.

You are at the entrance to a large cave in Mount Etamin.  It is rather
dark in here, and you can smell the odor of burned sulfur in the air.  A
sudden flash of flame gouts out from the recesses of the southern part of
the cave, illuminating the cavern in a yellowish light for a few seconds. 
Dazed and still seeing spots before you, you wonder if it would be safe to
go south.

Draco has collected over the centuries.  A rainbow of opulant colors bathe
you and awe-struck, you can do nothing but gape.
