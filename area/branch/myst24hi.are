is ruffled slightly by the breeze.  She is dressed in plum and raspberry
coloured raiments. She holds a creamy fragrant lotus blossom in one hand
and blesses you with gentle supplications. She looks like a very kind
goddess.

An old woman of the harvest sweeps the cobwebs from the skies.

This is Baba Yar in her first incarnation when she was first worshipped.

entirely of straw and wheat.  An earthy warm aura emanates from her
body.  Her long flowing straw hair is capped with a crown of silvery
wheat sheafs. She blesses the portals of entering and exiting life.

Baba Yaga, evil hag of the Thrice Tenth Kingdom~
Baba Yaga of the Thrice Tenth Kingdom cackles as she stirs her cauldron.
~
Having dabbled too closely in black magic, this goddess hag now emanates
an aura of pure evil and malevolence.  She pauses to pick a few shreds of

skilled at brewing trouble over the years.

This grieving goddess has laid frozen waste to the earth.
~
A tall majestic looking goddess wraps her thin azure cloak more closely
about her body as she brushes some snowflakes off her wheat colored hair.
Once beautiful to gaze upon, her features have been ravaged by sorrow and
grief.  Demeter, having lost her daughter, cares little if anyone else
lives or dies.

Gwion Bach~
This small boy is gathering firewood for a magical cauldron.
~
Gwion Bach appears to be a small boy but this is deceptively simply since
this is one of Taliesin's lesser forms.  His eyes are a glowing hazel and
he brushes strands of dampened black hair from his forehead.  Though a
sturdy lad, collecting all that firewood is rather hard work.

Quetzalcoatl the Plumed Serpent God~
Quetzalcoatl raises his arms skyward in drawing energy from the skies.
~
Legend states that he was the child of the Sun and a virgin goddess.
He was so filled with the love of all living things that he would
not pick a flower or harm an animal.  He ruled an empire of creativity
and kindness which greatly angered the crafty Lord of Death. Quetzalcoatl
symbolizes the union of matter and spirt, instinct and transcendence.

Tezcatlipoca the Crafty Lord of Death~
This crafty Lord of Death has a smile so cruel it chills the air.
~
Tezcatlipoca is tall of stature and very handsome or he would be if it
were not for the hard glittering look in his eyes.  Crafty beyond words,
he seems to have a talent for finding and using a person's vanity to
manipulate them as he did to Quezaltcoal by showing him a mirror which
made Quezaltcoal terrified of the signs of aging which he saw in that
mirror.

Coyote the Wily Trickster~
A large powerful silvery coyote is cavorting about leaping into the air.
~
This trickster-hero was much beloved in his native lands.  Though he varied
from kind to cruel and form naive to wily he has a vulnerability about
him which appealed to his followers.  Usually oversexed, indulging as he
pleased in food, drink and women it was said that he brought the world into
being.  They identified with the imperfections of this world which must
have been made by an imperfect creator, whose tricks often backfired.

Goddess of the Moon~
A beautiful goddess uses the lunar sphere to frame her visions.
~
Even the lovely Goddess of the Moon with all sorts of wonderful celestial
things to gaze at can get bored at times.  She cannot help but smile at
Coyote whose obvious enjoyment of this dancing is plain for all to see.
If he gets too boastful, she dances him over the cliffs where he doesn't
even notice the ground is no longer under his feet.

Entrance to Mystic Landscape~
A medium sized pond sparkles under the dancing sunbeams that swirl
towards it.  Everything around it seems to be mysteriously more alive from
the blue-green buzzing of the dragonfly to the verdant green of a water
lily pad topped with a creamy fragrant blossom.  You can also hear ancient
tales told by the shaman in this very spot.  A small sign is quietly posted

Willow that is rumored to gobble up wee folk.  The roots from magical

iced over withered stalks of grains and flanked by trees whose chilled

a square tiered artifact and someone has gone to a lot of trouble to layer
bands of turquoise which alternate with the golden sandstone. A radiant
diffused beam of shimmering golden-white light dances about the artifact.

draped round his shoulders secured by a round silver brooch inlaid with

that Diarmuid will die protecting his lover, Grainne, from the aged King
of the Fiana, Finn.  Legend has it that Finn was eventually deserted by his
army for continuing to hunt down the lovers. After Dairmuid's death, Grainne
