This is the entrence to Olean Forest.  Leaves of all colors slowly
descend from the trees, almost like a golden rain.  The trail is a muddy
mess, footprints of past travelers and rain have combined to destroy any
chance of walking at a fast pace.  The path leads North and South.

A {gTrail{x {rthrough {cOlean {GForest{x~
Your on a trail through Olean forest.  The sounds of birds and other
forest creatures are drowned out by a horrid screeching made by an animal,
or possibly a person, off in the distance.  The trees rise into the sky at
an un believeable height, and branch out, forming a canopy that does not
allow alot of light through, making it hard to see, even during light hours.
The path leads North and South.

A {CDead end {yin {rthe {gTrail{x~
Your on a trail through Olean forest.  Huge spiderwebs fill the backdrop
of the forest.  Cocoons, some reaching twelve feet in length hang from the
webs, the occasional twitch from inside the cocoon shows the recent
additions to the collection.  The trees rise into the sky at an un
believeable height, and branch out, forming a canopy that does not allow
alot of light through, making it hard to see, even during light hours.  The
trail comes to an end here.

A {DDark Room{x~
This is a dark room, even with a light source, it is still almost
impossible to see anything.  The sounds of dripping water echos throughout
the room.  South seems to be the only exit from here.
