1 sparkling ray sparklingray sparkling_ray~

Syntax: cast 'sparkling ray' <target> 

Sparkling Ray is a manifestation of the balance between good and evil.  The
caster first balances it within themselves and then focuses this balance on
their target, forcing the target to balance the good and evil within their
own soul.  
 
This is a spell related to the likes of {rRay of Truth{x and {rDemonfire{x.

152 tattoo~

10 of the tattoos are for sale for immqp.  They range in price from 10 - 50
immqps.  There are 4 quest prize tattoos, each tattoo offers a different
elemental resistance.  And there is one for your own personal use for a
reward, a boon for a follower, etc.  
{x
I'll get the prices for the basic ones posted in "help immqp" but here they
are for your review:

tattoo:  27816 - 50 hp/mana          27821 - 5 hr/dr     -- 10 immqps
         27817 - 100 hp/mana         27822 - 10 hr/dr    -- 20 immqps
         27818 - 150 hp/mana         27823 - 15 hr/dr    -- 30 immqps
         27819 - 200 hp/mana         27824 - 20 hr/dr    -- 40 immqps
         27820 - 250 hp/mana         27825 - 25 hr/dr    -- 50 immqps
{x
tattoo removal is 15 immqp.  Tattoo removal is only necessitated when
changing the bonus type of the tattoo like from hp/mana to a resist.  If
moving from an hp/mana to hr/dr or vice versa it is 15 immqp plus the price
of the new tattoo.  The only cost to increase the power of the tattoo is
the difference between the old and new.  For example: it is only 10 immqp
to go from 50 hp/mana to 100 hp/mana, but 35 to go from 50 hp/mana to
10 hr/dr.
{x
Please note switching between the quest or personal tattoos automatically
activates the 15 immqp removal cost.
{x
Quest & Personal Tattoos:
     27826 - flame - fire resist
     27827 - snowflake - cold resist
     27828 - lightning bolt - lightning resist
     27829 - acid flask - acid resist
     27830 - bare skin - personalized 50 hp/mana & 10 hr/dr
{x
You as imms are allowed to make items into tattoos for your own use.  If
you wish for a new tattoo to be created let Vartan17, Kira, and/or myself know
and we will debate it etc.  There will be a grand prize tattoo for suitably
hard quests just couldn't reach a consensus on it.
{x
Almost done, Any imm with load or clone, if given a template, and string 
can sell the tattoos. But only, Creators (159) & Imps (160+) can remove
tattoos, which is also required for upgrading them.  Also, only they can
make changes to the flags or settable options for the tattoos, in fact
for any item with the wear_tattoo flagged.

The only {cconstant{x in the {rworld{x is {cchange{x.  

Every day, things {Ychange{x.  {BPeople{x are born.  {YPeople{x {rdie{x.  {YChange {x is
inevitable.  

Some {Ypeople{x {Dstrive{x to {ccreate{x {Ychange{x.  

Those people are {RM{ra{Rc{rh{Ri{rn{Ra{X.  

Long ago, the {Bg{bo{Bd{x {RM{ra{Rc{rh{Ri{rn{Ra{x was worshipped by many {Ypeople{x.  These worshippers
were {Cp{ce{Ca{cc{Ce{cf{Cu{cl{x folk, dedicated to {Worder{x and {Ropposed{x to the {Bc{bh{Ba{bo{Bs{X created by
{RAlys{x.  {RAlys{x, seeking to {ddestroy{x these {Ypeople{x, captured {RM{ra{Rc{rh{Ri{rn{Ra{x and
imprisioned the {BG{bo{Bd{x in a {dcage{x.  The {yworshippers{x were plunged into {Bc{bh{Ba{bo{Bs{x
without the guidance of their {BG{bo{Bd{x.  But those {Gdedicated{x to order remembered
the deeds of {RM{ra{Rc{rh{Ri{rn{Ra{r'{Rs{x followers, and {dbanded{x together with them to bring
about the release of {RM{ra{Rc{rh{Ri{rn{Ra{x.  They did it through {Ychange{x, not through
{rviolence{x or {bwarfare{x.  

Since that day, {RM{ra{Rc{rh{Ri{rn{Ra{r'{Rs{x followers have been driven to bring about {Ychange{x
in all forms, not through {Rviolence{x, but through {Wwords{x and {wdeeds{x.  Those who
choose to walk that {Gpath{x are named for their {BG{bo{Bd{x: "a god from a machine,"
according to the {cancient{x {glegends{x.  Their {yvow{x is to create{Ychange{x to benefit
all, while opposing the {rviolence{x and {bchaos{x brought about by the dark {BG{bo{Bd{bd{Be{bs{Bs{x
{RAlys{x.

0 WAR~

{rGLOBAL WAR{x
Available commands:
	{gwar join{x	- join the war
	{gwar quit{x	- quit the war 
	{giwar{x	- toggle the war information channel on and off
	{gwar brag{x	- brag about your victories
	{gwar score{x	- see the stats for the current war
	{gwar start{x	- starts a global war [immortal only]
	{gwar stop{x	- stops the global war [immortal only]
	{gwar tournament{x - starts a tournament [immortal only]

When a global war is started you can join the war by typing {rWAR JOIN{x. During the war 
most of the PK restrictions are removed. The pk-level limit is extended to 20 up and down. 
This means that cross-tiers, non-pk clan members, non-clanned people, and people of same 
clans can fight each other within the war level limits.  

When you die you and your corpse are transported to the war body collection center. Fighting 
in the war body collection center is not allowed. You should stay there until you are fully 
recuperated before you rejoin the war.  

For all of those worried about your things, dying does not affect rot_death eq, PK records, 
your corpse is safe from looting and there will be no voodoos or zombies of you terrorizing 
the public. Also note that your floater will end up in your corpse, not on the ground. 

Suicide lands you a death but not a kill, so watch those mood swings. :)

Global war engulfs the entire world of Redemption, so NO PLACE IS SAFE. 
You can quit the war at any time by typing {rWAR QUIT{x provided you cool your violence.

War is an extension of Player killing, so all the regular PK rules apply during the war 
(with the exception of level/clan/tier and 30 min. limits on pk).

will be transported to the war battle zone.

There you fight until the last person standing wins.  (Note that you can not start fighting

PK records, etc.  Other war rules apply.

0 PKNEWBIES~

{rPK Newbies Clan{x

This clan offers a safe "no-risk" way for people to learn and try actual PK before they 
commit themselves to joining a PK clan. To join talk to a leader or type ({rpknew join{x).
When you join, you will be a part of a special group of PKers in training.  You will have 
a chance to go through a PK School (an area like mud school) that will teach you the basics 
of PK.

Then you can try it out by pking your fellow clan members or other PKers (without any risks 
to those other PKers). You can't be looted, nor can you loot anyone.

Your pk record can only be seen by you and only so that you can measure your own progress.
Once you graduate, your record will be cleared and you will be free to choose a clan to join, 
or choose to remain clanless.

You can only join this clan while you are relatively young, so you can't join at a high level.
Selected IMMs and distinguished mortal PKers may/will lead this clan. They, as well as any 
other IMM, can graduate PKnewbies at any time they think that the person is in the clan for 
wrong reasons, has already learned enough and can go on to the real thing, or if they have 
been in the clan too long, or reached a too high of a level.

All players can also graduate themselves ({rpknew graduate{x) when they feel ready to move on.

-1 ROLE PLAYING RP ROLEPLAY ROLEPLAYING~

...
On Redemption, roleplaying is entirely at your discretion.

This is a basic guide as to how to role-play more efficiently. 
Role-playing, or RP, can and does make mudding a lot more fun. One 
of the keys to role-playing is to be consistent. Have a character and 
always play it the same.

Remember, a character is just that, a character and not you. Try
different things. Don't let things on Redemption or anything on the net
affect you off of the net. This is a screen with words no more. This is
your character on the computer and is make believe. Keep that in mind.
If someone kills you, is rude to you, or trashes anything about you,
remember this is your character, NOT you. React to it as your character
would.

To get into a character, or rather become that character, to ACT and
REACT as the person you have created is not as easy as it may sound. You
must think like the character. ACTING and REACTING are the keys to
role-play *period* If you can do that, the rest is a walk in the park.

To actually do that acting you need to suspend you (the person) from you
(the character). For instance, you may see someone getting insulted or
attacked. Now, you (the person) may want to see that person killed for
their crimes or insults, you may resent them, possibly you will want to
interfere. But, if you (the character) is a blood-thirsty assassin or
reluctant to get into fights, then you would probably not interfere. You
may just cackle, grin, or laugh when things die.

The following is a list of the basics to help you create a character and
role-play that character:

1)You must define your character so, create a history for that character.
{x  Come up with a land from which you came, a family history perhaps. How
{x  did you receive your name? Why did you choose the profession you did?
{x  The complex, detailed, and in depth a history the better. A history is
{x  STRONGLY suggested.
2)Keep in mind your race at all times when role-playing. Certain races
{x  don't like magic or other races etc. For more information on how a
{x  specific race is supposed to act and the like, read the help files for
{x  that race or you can ask your local god.
3)Keep in mind your class when you RP. This can affect a character
{x  greatly. Read the help files for the classes or ask your local god for
{x  more information.
4)Don't forget to make a description for your character. This defines
{x  a character extremely. This is also STRONGLY suggested.
5)Don't make Out of Character comments over any channel except the
{x  designated channels or possibly private channels.
{x  This means ANYTHING. From have a bad day to the score on a sports
{x  event.
6)A good addition to role-play is to act as if you were actually there
{x  in the town. Use it's facilities. Go to the bar, the inn, or anything
{x  anywhere in the Realms. Things like this, using your environment and
{x  resources very helpful.
7)A great thing for role-play are socials and emotes. Emotes more so
{x  than socials because you can add your own quirks and personal spice.
8)Good RP includes a good name. To an extent, there is no limit to
{x  names, as long as you can role-play it. Though some names will still
{x  be restricted, just use common sense and no problems should arise. It is
{x  suggested that you use FANTASY based names, and names that reflect your
{x  character. Certain names go better with different races and classes. If
{x  you need help or suggestions for names ask your gods.
9)Anything can add to RP including your equipment. Sometimes it is
{x  more advantageous to use equipment that reflects your character more
{x  than just the best piece of eq. For example, a dwarven warrior, ;),
{x  could wear the dwarven plate mail or mithril mail. An extremely good or
{x  holy warrior might use Excalibur or a paladins sword. A vampire may
{x  wear bloody cloaks.

0 COLOUR COLOR ANSI~

        colour #            Sets your default colour to #
        colour <channel> #  Sets the channel colour to #

Use the list option to view a list of all the channels you can set a color
for, along with the color numbers to use for channels and the default color.

Using a number as the only argument will set your default color to this
number. (Default color is the color most text is displayed in)

Using a channel name as the first argument and a number as the second argument
will set this channels color to the number. for example:
       colour gossip 13
This will change the gossip channel color from the default bright blue to
bright magenta.

You may also talk in colour; the format is like this: the 'escape character'
to specify a colour is the left handed brace '{{', following that you should
use one of the following numbers,

         {x{{x     reset, returns to default

         {r{{r     red     {m{{m     magenta
         {g{{g     green   {c{{c     cyan
         {y{{y     yellow  {w{{w     white
         {b{{b     blue    {D{{D     grey{x

For brighter colours, use the shifted numbers: {RR{GG{YY{BB{MM{CC{WW{x
When using colour, it looks better if you finish the line with whatever
colour it would normally be in, such as a gossip, the colour is magenta, so:
                {mLope gossips '{ghello,{r world{m'{x
        looks better than:
                {mLope gossips '{ghello,{r world'{x

152 POINTS~

When running quests and giving out prizes please follow these guidelines:

For easy quests give 2 QP MAX (that means max of TWO points should be
distributed during the quest. Either 2 to a winner or 1 to two people).
These are quests like trivia quests, kill an easy mob, easy find objects etc.

For mediocre quests -  3 IMM QP to the winner (no more than 2 to others. That
is max of FIVE points to be distributed during the quest)
Examples of mediocre quests: kill a hard mob, find things you spread around
the mud, etc.

For harder quests - 5 IMM QP to winner (discretionary to others)
These are quests that take days to plan or hours to play, quests that involve mass
dying, or require a deep knowledge of the mud, or that involve group participation.
Note: {1Winner of NO quest should receive more than 5 IMM QP{x and
      {1No more than 10 IMM QP are to be distributed in ANY quest{x
But keep in mind, 10 is the absolute MAX and should be VERY rare. Usual quests should 
include no more than FIVE points total. These are guidelines for points only. Feel free to
supplement your point prizes by money, items, etc. Use discretion.

When people ask you to redeem their QP (according to the HELP QP):

-  Setting diceroll = increasing value v1 of the object by 1
-  Changing flags is done by (in case u didn't know) : 
{x flag obj <weapon name> weap <flag name>
-  Restringing = please restring ALL THREE fields (short, long, name) Also, when
{x doing a restring for ANYONE, always include "restrung" in the name field.
{x i.e. for Kira's sword do : string obj sword name kira sword restrung
-  Perfect IMM Enchant = you enchant until you get at least 6 enchants in. If the
{x object blows up load another one. If you can't load, clone it before you start
{x enchanting.

~
152 MQUEST MPOINT~

Syntax: mquest <object>
        mpoint <object>

MQUEST sets or removes the quest flag on any object.  A mortal character
may only carry ONE item with the quest flag set.

MPOINT sets or removes the questpoint flag on any object.  Any character
who then uses this object will receive a quest point.  The questpoint
flag is automatically removed from an object by the system once the
quest point has been given.

See help POINTS for quidelines on giving out Quest Points.
~
0 CONJURE~

Syntax: cast conjure

This spell will conjure up a powerful pet demon.  As pets, a demon cannot be
conjured if you already have a pet.  The conjure spell requires a special
source of power to be used, similar to the portal and nexus spells, though
not the same source.  Once this power is found, hold it in your hand prior
to casting of the spell.  The demon is bound to the power of the source, and
will disappear if you remove the source from your hand.  
~
0 VOODOO~

Syntax: cast voodoo
        voodoo <pin|trip|throw>

The voodoo spell will turn a sliced-off body part of a PC character into
a voodoo doll.  Hold the body part in your hand when casting.

The voodoo command can be used to inflict pain, trip, or throw another
player across the room (or sometimes out of the room).  Hold the
voodoo doll in your hand when using the command.

Voodoo dolls in your name can be destroyed with the help of the priests
in the church, but at a hefty price.

After the successful use of a voodoo doll, your victim will be immune to
the effects of another use for 1 tick.

{RWARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING{x
Having a voodoo doll in your inventory makes you vulnerable to
{RPKILL{x by the victim of the curse, with {RNO{x restrictions
of level, tier, or clan affiliation.
Because of this, you cannot give a voodoo doll to another person,
or use the transport spell on a doll, they must pick it up of their
own free will.  If you pick up your own voodoo doll, it will soon
vanish.
~
-1 GLADIATOR~

...{&Gladiator is the 2nd tier version of a Warrior, the most straight
forward and brutal of the classes.

A Gladiator's default weapon is a sword and other weapon skills are
easily obtained.  Gladiators also get bash, 2nd attack, scrolls,
staves and wands.

The Gladiator default group includes:

weapons master - the art of combat with all weapons
enhanced damage - increases the damage inflicted on opponents
shield block - The ability to let your shield take a hit for you

rescue - save your allies from damage in battle
disarm - the ability to make your opponent lose their weapon

~
-1 STRIDER~

...{&Striders are the 2nd tier version of Rangers, masters of the hunt.
They have a blend of Gladiator and Sage skills with the ability to
Ambush.  Since they aren't as adept as warriors when it comes to
fighting and Sages when it comes to using magic, the skills and spells
tend to be expensive.  Striders naturally receive the ability to use a
dagger and also get second attack for nothing.  At level 50 or so they
receive the ability to levitate shields, freeing both hands for
weapons.  

Strider default includes:

weapons master - the art of combat with all weapons
parry - the art of avoiding blows  
envenom - the ability to poison a weapon or another item
kick - a non-magical extra attack
third attack - the ability to get 3 hits in one round
enhanced damage - multiplies damage in battle
hand to hand - the ability to fight without a weapon
beguiling - mental attack spells
curative - the ability to cure diseases, blindness and poison
healing - spells that replenish health and movement
protective - protective spells coupled with spells that dispel the
{&     magic on others 
transportation - the ability to freely move objects, others, and 
{&     yourself from place to place{x
~
-1 PRIEST~

...{%Priests are the 2nd tier version of Clerics, the masters of protective
and healing spells.  Priests are often coveted by groups for their
ability to heal others and themselves.  Priests are also fair in the
ways of fighting with weapons.  They can be impressive with attack
spells, but still don't match the ability of a Wizard.  Priests at
level 40 can levitate shields.

The default weapon for a Priest is a mace, and other weapon skills are
obtained at an expensive cost.  They naturally receive scrolls, wands
and staves.

Priest default includes:

flail - skill with flail type weapons
attack - offensive spells
benedictions - employing the help of a deity to aid you
creation - the creation of physical objects such as food and water
curative - the ability to cure diseases, blindness and poison
detection - informational magic such as detect invis and locate object
healing - spells that replenish health and movement 
maladictions - a blend of diseases, curses and illnesses 
protective - protective spells coupled with spells that dispel the magic on others 
transportation -the ability to freely move objects, others and yourself from place to place 
weather - elemental based attacks{x
~
-1 LICH~

...{&Liches are the 2nd tier answer to the vampire class, the undead
masters of mind control.  Liches hold the ability to drink blood to
revive themselves, thus not needing any kind of heal spells.  Vampires
are killers, though not as adept at sneaking as thieves, they are more
magical in nature and get spell classes relatively cheap.

Liches naturally have the ability to use daggers, sneak and hide

Lich default includes:

backstab - hitting your opponent by surprise
fast healing - increased hitpoint regeneration
Shield Block - The ability to let your shield take a hit for you
dodge - Avoiding an opponents attack
hand to hand - the ability to fight without a weapon
disarm - the ability to make your opponent lose their weapon
Beguiling - mental attack spells
detection - informational magic such as detect invis and locate object
enhancement - spells that enhance the body's natural abilities
illusion - deceptive magic 
maladictions - a blend of diseases, curses and illnesses 
transportation - the ability to freely move objects, others and yourself from place to place {x
~
-1 SAGE~

...{&Sages are the 2nd tier version of Druids, masters of the elements. 
They have a good mix of healing, protective and attack spells, but
aren't quite as adept as Priests and Wizards at their respective
trades.  Sages are however better suited for combat than their fellow
magic users. Sages can also levitate Shields at level 65.

Sages naturally receive wands, scrolls and staves along with their
default weapon, polearm.  Other weapon skills are obtained at a very
reasonable cost.

Sage default includes:
attack - offensive spells
benedictions - employing the help of a deity to aid you
creation - the creation of physical objects such as food and water
combat - devastating offensive spells like acid blast and fire ball
curative - the ability to cure diseases, blindness and poison 
healing- spells that replenish health and movement 
protective - protective spells coupled with spells that dispel the magic on others
weather -elemental based attacks{x
~
-1 WIZARD~

...{&Wizards are the 2nd tier version of Mages, the masters of offensive,
illusion and enchantment magics.  Due to their bookish nature, Wizards
tend to be weak in the ways of weapon and hand to hand combat and
prefer to use their wit to win a battle. Wizards naturally get the
ability to levitate shields.

A Wizard's default weapon in a dagger and other weapon skills are
obtained at an expensive cost.  Wizards also naturally obtain scrolls,
staves and wands.

Wizard default includes:

Beguiling - mental attack spells
combat - devastating offensive spells like acid blast and fireball
detection - informational magic such as detect invis and locate object
enhancement - spells that enhance the body's natural abilities
illusion - deceptive magic
maladictions - a blend of diseases, curses and illnesses 
protective - protective spells coupled with spells that dispel the magic on others 
shielding - Auras that return damage to opponents
transportation - the ability to freely move objects, others and yourself from place to place 
weather - elemental based attacks{x
~
-1 IMPALE~

Syntax: IMPALE <victim>

Warriors and Striders have developed their strength and skill to such a
point that they are able to impale their opponents on the ends of their
weapons, causing massive damage.  It is a difficult skill to master, and
thus is only available to the most skilled members of their classes.  Note
that this skill is ineffective against badly wounded people, who will be
careful not to allow you to injure them further with this skill.  
~
-1 WEAPON CLEAVE~

Syntax: WEAPON CLEAVE <victim>

Some fighters have developed the skill to destroy the weapon of their
opponent in battle, effectively rendering them defenseless.  Once trained,
you will automatically attempt to break the weapon.  Success ruins the
weapon.  
~
-1 SHIELD CLEAVE~

Syntax: SHIELD CLEAVE <victim>

This skill is practiced by those who wanted to develop a more direct method
of getting through the shield of their intended victims.  Once trained, you
will automatically attempt to sunder the shield of your victim in the middle
of combat, destroying it and leaving your opponent more vulnerable to your
attacks.  
~
-1 STRANGLE~

Syntax: STRANGLE <victim>

This skill, practiced by Thieves and Mercenaries, will attempt to put a
strangle hold on your intended target.  If successful, the victim will be
put to sleep for a short while, leaving them open to attack.

~
0 BRIEF COMPACT~

Brief and compact help set your display options for the game. Typing brief
toggles on and off the showing of room descriptions when you move around
(considerably reducing the text to be processed), and typing compact 
removes the extra blank line before your prompt.
~
0 REALQUIET~

This extreme little command disables a large number of the messages
in the game that do not affect you directly.  By setting this flag,
you will not see people manipulate objects or cast spells, or basically
do any mundane thing that does not affect you directly.  Communications
(including say and tell) are not affected by this flag, and nor is the
ability to see people arrive or leave.
~
0 DAMAGE~

The following are the damage messages, and the max amount of hp damage
for each message:
{&	0	miss		4	scratch
	8	graze		12	hit
	16	injure		20	wound
	24	maul		28	decimate
	32	devastate	36	maim
	40	MUTILATE	44	DISEMBOWEL
	48	DISMEMBER	52	MASSACRE
	56	MANGLE		60	DEMOLISH
	75	DEVASTATE	100	OBLITERATE
	125	ANNIHILATE	150	ERADICATE
        200     NUKES		250	BUTCHERS
	300	IMPLODES	350	OVERHAULS
	400   	NUKES X2	500	BUTCHERS X2
	600	IMPLODES X2	700 	OVERHAULS X2
	1000 	UNSPEAKABLE	1000+   UNSPEAKABLE X2 
        5000+   INSTANT HEART SURGERY{x
~
-1 DEAF~

The deaf toggle turns off incoming tells, helpful if you are being bombarded
by messages from other players.  You can still use reply (see 'help reply') to
reply to people who were telling you before you went deaf, although you
cannot reply to a deaf person unless you or they are a deity (it's mostly 
useful for sending a quick "I'm being spammed so I went deaf" message to
a person).
~
-1 AFK REPLAY~

Typing AFK puts your character in a tell-saving mode as follows: any tell
to you is stored in a special buffer, and can be seen later by typing
recall.  This is useful when you need to leave the mud for 5 or 10 minutes,
but don't want to miss tells.  AFK shows up in your prompt until it is
turned off.

Tells to link-dead players are stored in a similar fashion, and can also be
seen by typing REPLAY (unless, of course, the character logs off before
reading them).

Tells stored during a fight can be seen by typing REPLAY.
~
0 HOUSES 'PLAYER HOUSING' HOUSE~

* Houses cost 75 immqps: includes 1 room, 1 fountain, 1 furniture (with
{x  a max of 100/100 heal/mana regeneration) and decorations.
* They only exit into Redemption Plaza.
* They have keys ONLY - provided by the keykeeper mob.  No gate mobs.
* All rooms are no_recall, safe, indoors, nowhere.
* Houses will built by a high-level immortal on the build port (note
{x  with your specifications).
* No healer mobs or shops.
* Extra rooms cost 25 immqps each.
* Extra mobs cost 5 (15 with mprogs) immqps each (non gateable).
* Extra furniture costs 2 immqps each.
~
0 NAMES NAMING~

There is a new name rule in effect, it says:

1) No common ENGLISH words
2) No OFFENSIVE names

THAT'S IT. That means, specifically that:
a) variations of words, or misspelled words ARE ok.  ex: Fyre
b) combination words ARE ok. ex: SwordDancer (well its a mob, but if it wasnt), LightDragon, etc.

Be ORIGINAL!  Don't take your name from a soap powder or a cartoon character.  Use common sense 
and if you are REALLY stuck, use a fantasy name generator such as the one at: 
http://spitfire.ausys.se/johan/names/

One more exception, names that ARE words MAY be ok if the player has used that name 
for a long long time (we call it "grandfather clause").

~
0 WIZLIST~

Syntax: wizlist

WIZLIST shows the list of the IMMortals of Redemption and their levels.
~
0 DEATH~

When your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the Altar of the Temple
of Midgaard.  Your corpse is left behind in the room where you were killed,
together with all of your equipment.  Unless you are under level 25, in which
case it will be in the morgue (help morgue) with the exception of your floater.

Any spells which were affecting you are cancelled by death.

Following and groups are not affected by death.

You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is two-thirds of 
the way back to the beginning of your level.

Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside (mob) corpses decay with them.
Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real time).
Only the player who died can retrieve objects from his/her own corpse unless
he/she types NOLOOT, in which case anyone can grab the corpse.

**NOTE** When player corpses decay, items in them drop to the ground.
~
0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~

Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need a set 
amount of experience points for each level based on your creation points.

You gain experience by:

    being part of a group that kills a monster

You lose experience by:

    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of certain spells
    dying

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your 
alignment
versus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have been killed
lately; and some random variation.
~
0 PET PETS~

You can buy pets in the pet shop.  You may own only one pet at a time, after 
the old one dies you may purchase a replacement.
~
0 BOUNTY~

You can place Bounties on Players through your Clan Leaders ONLY.
Bounties are the level of the player * 25 platinum. 
i.e. for a Bounty on a Level 100 player it is 2500 Platinum.
to remove a Bounty on yourself it is your level * 40 platinum
is to remove a bounty at Level 100 4000 Platinum.
~
0 FLAG FLAGS~

The following are the description flags for players and mobiles:
      {x[{yV{DH{GC{bT{wP{CI{rF{BL{WH{RE{YG{WS{x]
Where:
       {yV{x = Invisible
        {DH{x = Hiding
         {GC{x = Charmed
          {bT{x = Translucent (pass_door)
           {MP{x = Faerie Fire
            {CI{x = Ice Shield
             {rF{x = Fire Shield
              {BL{x = Shock Shield
               {WH{x = Holy Shield /{0{x = Unholy
                {RE{x = Evil
                 {YG{x = Good
                  {WS{x = Sanctuary

The following are the description flags for equipment:
      {x[{yV{RE{BB{MM{YG{WH{GQ{x]
Where:
       {yV{x = Invisible
        {RE{x = Evil
         {BB{x = Blessed
          {MM{x = Magical
           {YG{x = Glowing
            {WH{x = Humming
             {GQ{x = Quest

You may switch to the old format for flags (as used on other
muds) at any time with the 'long' command.
~
0 LONG~

The LONG command will affect the way you see special flags on other
characters and equipment.  With the long flag set, you will see the
flags much as you do on other muds, most of them as (Aura)'s.
Without the long flag (default), you will see any flags within
a much shorter table.  See 'HELP FLAGS' for the shorter tables.
~
0 TICK~

Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.
~
0 !~

Syntax: !

! repeats the last command you typed.
~
0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN~

Syntax: north
Syntax: south
Syntax: east
Syntax: west
Syntax: up
Syntax: down

Use these commands to walk in a particular direction.
~
0 CAST~

Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells.
~
0 EXITS~

Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).
~
0 ROB~

Syntax: rob <amount>

While holding a passbook randomly attained by murdering someone in PK, use the 
ROB command to take money from the persons bank account whose passbook you have
attained.  The passbook will dissolve after the rob command is used once.  

Note:  The amount is always in platinum and requires no other argument.
Note:  You can only be successful with an amount less than or equal to the
amount they have deposited and only at a bank they have deposited money at.
see help COMPROMISE.
~
0 COMPROMISED COMPROMISE~

If you have just been murdered or pk'd, your killer now has your passbook.
This means that on typing SCORE, you'll see that one of your accounts will
say COMPROMISED next to it.

Your killer doesn't know which bank your funds are at, so don't advertise
it on channels.  Instead, move the funds as soon as possible to a non-
compromised account.

see help ROB.
~
0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~

Syntax: drop <object>
Syntax: drop <amount> coins
Syntax: get  <object>
Syntax: get  <object> <container>
Syntax: give <object> <character>
Syntax: give <amount> coins <character>
Syntax: put  <object> <container>

DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.

GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even
from a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.

GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.

PUT puts an object into a container.

DROP, GET and PUT understand the object names 'ALL' for all objects and
'ALL.object' for all objects with the same name.
~
0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~

Syntax: equipment
Syntax: inventory

EQUIPMENT lists your equipment (armor, weapons, and held items).
INVENTORY lists your inventory.
~
0 COMPARE~

Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>
Syntax: compare <object>
 
COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,
it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.
 
COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.
 
COMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects.
~
0 KILL MURDER~

Syntax: kill   <mob>
Syntax: murder <player>

The KILL command will attack a mob with your weapons or hands.

The MURDER command will attack a player (within your pk range) with your weapons
or hands.

Note: The MURDER command can be used on mobs and players.  The KILL command can
only be used on mobs.
~
0 AMBUSH~

Syntax: ambush <victim>

Ambush is similar to the skill of backstab, in that it initates a surprise
attack against a target, causing massive damage.  The user will have to take
time to recover afterwards, and will be unable to issue any commands for the
first few rounds of combat.  It is usable only by trained Rangers and
Striders.  
~
0 FINGER~

Syntax: finger <name>
The finger command will tell you the last time a player logged off
the system.  The entered name must match the players name completely,
and cannot be abbreviated.
~
0 FLEE~

Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue   <character>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, then fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.
~
0 METAL ARMOR~

Syntax:  Metalarmor
This skill is an AC boost for Gladiator's and Mercenary's Only.
~
0 MITHRIL GLAZE~

~
0 ORDER~

Syntax: order <character> command
Syntax: order all command

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggressive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.
~
0 REST SLEEP STAND SIT WAKE~

Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake
Syntax: sit
Syntax: sit in <object>
Syntax: sit on <object>

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.

Use SIT to sit on or in an object in the room.  If used alone you
will sit on the ground.
~
0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~

Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''
is a synonym for SAY.

boards is restricted. The 'unread' command can be used to show your unread
notes on all the note spools.

ASK and ANSWER are channels that work together as a way for players to gain
information about the mud and to get help.

The AUCTION channel is for players to sell and buy valuables publicly.

OOC is the out of character channel.  This is the only channel where real life
emotions, feelings, and comments should be expressed.  Other channels are
considered in character and to be used to express the feelings, emotions, and
comments of your character regardless of real life situations.

GRATS is used for congratulating characters on accomplishments such as leveling,
heroing, etc.  Triggers on this channel are FROWNED upon.  Annoying triggers will

The MUSIC channel is used for singing.  This is a global channel and can be heard all
over the mud.  (Please be on pitch)

QUOTE is a global channel used for quoting interesting comments.

YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.

CHANNELS shows you a list of the channels available to you and whether or not you have

forgotten.
~
0 DEPOSIT WITHDRAW BANK BANKING~

DEPOSIT and WITHDRAW are used for banking on Redemption.  DEPOSIT adds money to your
account at the bank you are located at.  WITHDRAW takes money from your account at

EMOTE is used to express emotions or actions.  Besides EMOTE, there are
several dozen built-in social commands, such as CACKLE, HUG, and THANK
(type socials for a listing).

PMOTE is similar to emote, but will substitute you and your for a target's
name (i.e. pmote bonks Alander will be read as bonks you by Alander, and
as bonks Alander by everyone else).

POSE produces a random message depending on your class.
~
152 SMOTE~

Syntax: smote <action>

Smote works exactly like pmote, except you must place your name somewhere in
the string, and it will show that string to everyone in the room.
~
0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~

from other factors (spells or items).  

SHOW allows you to see your affects within your SCORE.  

WORTH is similar to SCORE but will only display your coins, your total 
experience gained since birth, and the amount of experience you need to gain

Syntax: close    <object|direction>
Syntax: lock     <object|direction>
Syntax: unlock   <object|direction>
Syntax: pick     <object|direction>
Syntax: bashdoor <object|direction>
OPEN and CLOSE open and close an object or a door.

LOCK and UNLOCK lock and unlock a closed object or door.  You must have
the requisite key to LOCK or UNLOCK.

PICK can open a lock without having the key.  In order to PICK successfully,
you must practice the appropriate skill.

BASHDOOR like PICK can gain entry without having a key.  However, this is done
by successfully knocking the door down.  Like pick, the appropriate skill
must be practiced to BASHDOOR successfully.
~
0 SHARPEN~

Syntax: sharpen <weapon>

Use of this skill allows you to sharpen a weapon, allowing it to do more
damage.  Almost any weapon can be improved through the use of this skill,
despite what you may think.  It has no effect against weapons that are
already sharp.  

Note that this skill only sharpens the top weapon in your inventory. 
Dropping then picking up the weapon can help, as can giving the weapon to
yourself.  
~
0 DRINK EAT FILL POUR~

Syntax: drink <object>
Syntax: eat   <object>
Syntax: fill  <object>
Syntax: pour  <object> out
Syntax: pour  <object> <object>
Syntax: pour  <object> <character>

When you are thirsty, DRINK something.

When you are hungry, EAT something.

FILL fills a drink container with water.

POUR transfers a liquid to a container, or empties one (pour <thing> out).
You can also pour from an object into something a character is holding.
~
0 BUY LIST SELL VALUE~

Syntax: buy   <object>
Syntax: list
Syntax: sell  <object>
Syntax: value <object>

BUY buys an object from a shop keeper.
When multiple items of the same name are listed, type 'buy n.item', where n
is the position of the item in a list of that name.  So if there are two
swords, buy 2.sword will buy the second. If you want to buy multiples of
an item, use an * (buy 5*pie will buy 5 pies).  These can be combined into
(for example) buy 2*2.shield, as long as the * is first.  

LIST lists the objects the shop keeper will sell you.
List <name> shows you only objects of that name.

SELL sells an object to a shop keeper.

VALUE asks the shop keeper how much he, she, or it will buy the item for.

~
0 SACRIFICE~

Syntax: sacrifice <object>

SACRIFICE offers an object to your god, who may reward you.
The nature of the reward depends upon the type of object.
~
0 SCROLL PAGING ROWS~

Syntax: scroll
Syntax: scroll <number>

This command changes the number of lines the mud sends you in a page (the 
default is 24 lines).  Change this to a higher number for larger screen
sizes, or to 0 to disabling paging.
~
0 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP~

Syntax: brandish
Syntax: quaff    <potion>
Syntax: recite   <scroll> <target>
Syntax: zap      <target>
Syntax: zap

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed
to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the
<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a
magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting
someone, then that character is used for a target.

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single
charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no
more charges, it will be consumed.

These commands may require an item skill to be successful, see the help entries
on the skills scrolls, staves, and wands for more information.
~
0 CONSIDER~

Syntax: consider <character>

CONSIDER tells you what your chances are of killing a character.
Of course, it's only a rough estimate and doesn't take their weapon
into consideration.
~
0 FOLLOW GROUP NOFOLLOW~

Syntax: follow <character>
Syntax: group
Syntax: group <character>
Syntax: nofollow

FOLLOW starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone else,
just FOLLOW <yourself>.

NOFOLLOW toggles your ability to follow others or have anyone follow you.  It
also terminates any groups of which you are the leader.

GROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and
SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight (unless you have autoassist switched off).

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.

You may FOLLOW and GROUP only with characters who are within five levels of
your own.
~
0 VISIBLE~

VISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
making you visible again.
~
0 QUIT RENT SAVE~

Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: RENT ... not!
Syntax: SAVE

SAVE saves your character and object.  The game saves your character every
15 minutes regardless, and is the preferred method of saving.  Typing save
will block all other command for about 20 seconds, so use it sparingly.
(90+ players all typing save every 30 seconds just generated too much lag)

Some objects, such as keys, may not be saved.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere.  When you re-enter the 
game 
you will be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

There is no RENT in this mud.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.
~
0 PUSH DRAG~

Syntax:  push <target>
Syntax:  drag <target>

PUSH allows you to push a {Rviolent player{x from the room in which he/she/it is
standing.

DRAG is similar to PUSH except you go with the person.

Success of PUSH and DRAG depend upon your size versus your targets as well as
the amount of hit-pts you both have.

Note:  Both you and the target must be flagged {Rviolent{x.
~
0 READ~

Syntax:  read <target>

If you are literate, the READ command allows you to, guess what, read signs,
maps, inscriptions, and other various and sundry items.
~
0 REPENT ALIGNMENT ALIGN~

Syntax:  repent align
Syntax:  curse align

The REPENT and CURSE commands allow you to change you alignment with monetary
offerings at the chapel of the god whose alignment you wish to be.  Both chapels
are located in Midgaard and are on the Map of Midgaard.
~
0 RECALL /~

Syntax: RECALL

RECALL prays to your god for miraculous transportation from where you are
back to the Temple of Midgaard.  '/' is a synonym for RECALL.
If you are a member of a clan that has it's own reincarnation room,
your god will transport you there, unless you have been labeled a thief
or killer.

If you RECALL during combat, you will lose experience (more than for fleeing),
and you will have a chance of failing (again, more than for fleeing).  This
chance is based on your recall skill, although a 100% recall does not 
insure success.

RECALL costs 1/4 of your movement points.

RECALL doesn't work in certain god-forsaken rooms.  Characters afflicted by a
curse may not recall at all.
~
-1 SPLIT~

Syntax: SPLIT <silver> <gold>

SPLIT splits some coins  between you and all the members of your
group who are in the same room as you.  It's customary to SPLIT
the loot after a kill.  The first argument is the amount of silver
the split (0 is acceptable), and the second gold (optional).
Examples:
split 30 	--> split 30 silver
split 20 50	--> split 20 silver, 50 gold
split  0 10	--> split 10 gold
~
0 STEAL~

Syntax: STEAL coins <character>
Syntax: STEAL <object> <character>

STEAL attempts to steal coins, or an object, from a character.

There are penalties for using STEAL on other players.

In order to STEAL successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.
~
0 PRACTICE~

Syntax: PRACTICE
Syntax: PRACTICE <skill|spell>

PRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in all
the skills and spells available to you.  You can check this anywhere.

PRACTICE with an argument practice that skill or spell.  Your learning
percentage varies from 0% (unlearned) to a some maximum between 80% and 100%,
depending on your class.  You must be at a guild master to practice.

The higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice
session.  The higher your wisdom, the more practice sessions you will
have each time you gain a level.  Unused sessions are saved until you
do use them.
~
0 TRAIN~

Syntax: train <str int wis dex con hp mana>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class, and several
initial training sessions.  You can increase your attributes by
using these sessions at a trainer (there are several in town).

It takes one training session to improve an attribute, or to increase
mana or hp by 10.  You receive one session per level.

The best attributes to train first are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more
practice when you gain a level.  CON gives you more hit points.
In the long run, your character will be most powerful if you train
WIS and CON both to 18 before practicing or training anything else.
~
161 ADVANCE~

Syntax: advance <character> <level>

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.
~
161 TRUST~

Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
~
160 REBOOT SHUTDOWN COPYOVER~

Syntax: reboot
	shutdown
        copyover

Reboot shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of fifteen seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

Shutdown shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.

Copyover is a hot reboot which allows the players to stay on the game.
~
152 CLONE~

Syntax:
  clone obj <object>
  clone mob <mobile>
  clone obj number <name>
  clone <name>

The clone command duplicates an object or mobile.  The level of item or mobile
that may be cloned depends on your level.  The target object or mob must be in
the same room as you, or in your posession.  Strung and set information is
preserved by clone, as well as any spell effects and container contents or
mobile inventory, except for items which are too high for you to clone.  
By giving a number before the name of the object to be cloned, you can clone
multiple copies at once, which is less spammy to other immortals and players.
 
Codders is the only imm allowed to do the cloned sets for players.
~
159 WIZLOCK NEWLOCK~

Syntax: wizlock
	newlock

Wizlock and newlock both block login attempts to Redemption. Wizlock locks
out all non-gods (i.e. level less than 152), except for link-dead players who
are returning.  Newlock only locks out new character generation, typically
used for preventing a spammer from returning.  Wizlocking should be avoided,
and newlocking should be accompanied by mail or a note to the imps.
~
157 DENY ERASE~

Syntax: deny <name>
        erase <name>

DENY and ERASE lock a character out of a game permanently, rendering their
character name unusable.  They may only be removed by editing the pfile, for
this reason freeze is usually preferred.

If a player is DENY'd, they will be sent a message telling them so, then
will be forced to quit.  They will then receive a message telling them
they are denied access any time they try to connect.

If a player is ERASED, they will receive no message, and will be immediately
disconnected.  They will immediately be disconnected any time they attempt
to connect, with no explanation.
~
155 DISCONNECT IDISCONNECT~

Syntax: idisconnect <name>
Syntax: idisconnect <port number>

Disconnect breaks a player's link to the game, dumping them back to the telnet
prompt.  This is a non-lethal way of getting rid of spammers and annoying
players.  Use 'sockets' command to find the port they entered the mud on.
~
157 FREEZE JAIL~

Syntax: freeze <name>
Syntax: jail   <name>

FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all. It can be removed from within the game, so freezing a 
troublemaker is usually a better option than they deny command.
JAIL is a one word command for corner, freeze, deny -- permanently.
~
156 CORNER~

Syntax: corner <name>

CORNER <character> puts the character in the corner.
Basically its the same as 'trans <player> 3'.
~
152 NOGATE~

This prevents gating and summoning throughout the mud.
It is used for quests where this isn't permitted.
~
154 ANNOUNCE~

Syntax: announce <text>

This sends an announcement mudwide to all those listening to the grats
channel, with the text of your choice.
~
155 CHECK~

Syntax: check        display info about players
        check stats  display info and resume stats
        check eq     resume eq of all players

If there are a lot of players on, DO NOT use 'check eq' as this may cause
the mud to crash.
Use the stat command in case of doubt about someone.
~
158 DUPE~

Syntax: dupe <character> <name>

DUPE will add or remove a dupe account name to a list kept on the players
account.  Anytime this player connects, all characters on their dupe list
will be forced to quit (except immortals).  This should be used only on
those who flagrantly violate the rule against bringing in more than one
character at a time and using one character to build a second.  Entering
a dupe that is already on the list will cause it to be removed.

Using DUPE <character> without the second argument will list that
characters current dupes.
~
158 FORCE FORCEDELETE~

Syntax: force <character> <command>
Syntax: force all <command>
Syntax: forcedelete <player>

FORCE forces one character to execute a command, except of course delete.

Below level 159 force can only be used on mobiles.

FORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command.
This is typically used for 'force all save'.

FORCEDELETE forces a character to delete, typically after they have been
ploaded.
~
152 SOCKETS~

Syntax: sockets
	sockets <name> 

SOCKETS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including 
users in the process of logging in.  The two numbers inside brackets are the 
channel number and the 'connected' state.  The 'connected' states are listed in 
merc.h: 0 is CON_PLAYING; non-zero values are various states of logging in.

The optional name argument shows the site of a player, or optional can be used
to identify switched gods (i.e. socket orc shows the name of anyone switched
into an orc).
~
153 LOAD~

Syntax: load mob <vnum>
	load obj <vnum> <level>

The load command is used to load new objects or mobiles (use clone to 
duplicate strung items and mobs).  

Vnums can be found with the vnum command, or by stat'ing an existing mob or object.

Load puts objects in inventory if they can be carried, otherwise they are
put in the room.  Mobiles are always put into the same room as the god.
(see also clone, stat)
~
155 SET~

Syntax: set mob   <mobile> <field> <value>
	set obj   <object> <field> <value>
	set room  <number> <field> <value>
	set skill <char>   <name>  <rating>
	set skill <char>   all     <rating>

The set command is used to change the numerical values of the various data
structures. Type set <class> without an argument to see a listing of options.
Set skill all (pc's only) will set all the character's skills to the value
given.  Use string to change the strings on an object or mobile.
(see also string, stat, flag)
~
152 STRING RESTRING~

Syntax: string obj <field> <string>
	string mob <field> <string>

The string command changes the various strings associated with an object or
mobile.  A full list of fields can be viewed by typing string obj or string

Syntax: nochannel <character>
	noclan    <character>
	noemote   <character>
	norestore <character>
	noshout   <character>
	notell    <character>
	notitle   <character>
        noviolent <character>

NOEMOTE, NOSHOUT, and NOTELL are used to muffle other characters, by
preventing them from emoting, shouting, and telling, respectively.
Characters who are noshout'ed or no'telled will also not receive those
forms of communication.

The NOCHANNEL command is similar, but more drastic. It prevents the victim
from using any of the channels (gossip, cgossip, Q/A, music) on the game.
Nochannels usually result from swearing or spamming on public channels.

The NORESTORE command makes a player immune to the restore command.
This is used to punish players who constantly ask for restores from
immortals.

The NOCLAN command makes a player unable to join pkill-type clans.
This is used to punish players who are known to cause serious troubles
with pkilling.

The NOTITLE command makes a player unable to set their own title.
This is used to punish players who use the title for swearing,
threats, etc....

The NOVIOLENT command clears a players violent flag.  (So that they can
leave the mud in the case of a hurried shutdown for example).
~
159 TWIT PARDON~

Syntax: twit   <character>
        pardon <character>

TWIT sets the Twit flag on a player.  When set, the twit flag causes
any mobiles in a LAW room (all of Midgaard) to attack the player,
and the shopkeepers will not sell to the player.  Also, any player may
attack and kill a player with the twit flag, whether they can normally
pkill or not.

PARDON will remove the Twit flag if set.
~
152 PURGE~

Syntax: purge
	purge <character>

Purge is used to clean up the world.  Purge with no arguments removes all the
NPC's and objects in the current room.  Purge with an argument purges one
character from anywhere in the world.

Purge will not get rid of PC's, or objects or mobiles with a NOPURGE flag
set (i.e. the pit, the fountain, shopkeepers, Hassan).  Mobiles may be
purged if they are called directly by name.
~
159 RESTORE~

Syntax: restore <character>
	restore room
	restore all

Restore restores full hit points, mana points, and movement points to the
target character.  It also heals poison, plague, and blindness.

Restore room (or restore with no argument) performs a restore on every player
in the room, restore all does the same for all connected players. Restore all
is only usable by creators and implementors.  Restore should be used sparingly
or not at all.

Restore doesn't work on violent players.
~
158 SLAY~

Syntax: slay <character>

Slay kills a character in cold blood, no saving throw.  Best not to use this
command on players if you enjoy being a god.
~
152 Transfer~

Syntax: transfer <character>
	transfer all
	transfer <character> <location>
	transfer all         <location>

Transfer transfers the target character, or ALL player characters,
to your current location (default) or to a specified location. Trans all 
should almost never be used, as 100 players popping into one room can have
horrible effects on slow links. Teleport is a synonym for transfer. 
~
152 RECOVER~

Syntax: recover <character>

Recover transfers the target character to their default recall point.
You may only recover a character who is either cursed, or is stuck in
a no-recall area.
~
154 AT~

Syntax: at <location> <command>

At executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given
location.  The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of
a mobile, or as the name of an object.

At works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the
command, and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your
location).
~
153 ECHO GECHO PECHO ZECHO WECHO~

Syntax: echo  <message>
	gecho <message>
        zecho <message>
	pecho <character> <message>

These commands all perform similar functions.  Echo sends the message to
all characters in the same room as the user, with no indication of who sent
it.  Gecho does the same for all players connected to the game, and pecho
sends the message to the player specified as the target.  Zecho sends an echo
into that zone or area only.  Wecho is the bright red and blue announcement 
used by 160 Gods.  Any higher-level god will see a prompt in front of your 
message, informing him or her that it is an echo.
~
152 GOTO VIOLATE~

Syntax: goto
        goto <location>
        violate <location>

Goto takes you to a location.  The location may be specified as a vnum,
as the name of a mobile, or as the name of an object.

Goto with no argument will take you to your default location if you
have one set. (see GSET)  If used in this manner, your pet will be
transferred with you.

You may not Goto a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters
already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters
already present. Some other rooms are barred to players below a certain
god level.

Creators can use the VIOLATE command to get into private rooms.
~
152 GSET~

Syntax: gset <vnum>

Gset allows you to set the default location for the goto command to
take you to.
~
152 HOLYLIGHT INVIS WIZINVIS~

Syntax: holylight
	wiznvis <level>

Holylight is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

Wizinvis takes a level argument, and will make you invisible to all players of
a lower level than your invisibility level.  It defaults to the maximum
(your level) if no argument is given.  Wizi 160 characters are totally 
invisible.
~
152 INCOGNITO GHOST~

Toggling your incognito status will hide your presence from people outside the
room you are in, but leave you visible to those who are with you.

Toggling your ghost status will do the exact opposite, making you invisible
to anyone in the same room as you, but visible to those outside the room.
While ghost is set, you will still appear visible to all characters in the
game through the 'who' command. (depending on your wizinv level)

Both take a level argument similar to wizinvis, people at that level
or higher can see you regardless of location.
These flags are mutually exclusive, turning on one will automatically turn
the other off.
~
152 MEMORY~

Syntax: memory

Memory reports the size of your mud.

The 'Mobs' and 'Objs' lines report the number of types of mobiles and objects,
not the number of instances currently in the game.

The 'Strings' line shows memory used by area-file strings.  These strings have
a maximum limit, which is also shown.

The 'Perms' line shows permanently allocated memory blocks.  There is no limit
on the number and size of these blocks.
~
153 VNUM~

Syntax: vnum <name>
	vnum <obj or mob> <name>
	vnum skill <name>
	vnum area

Vnum finds all objects and mobiles with a particular name, and prints out
the results.  Use vnum obj or vnum mob to limit the search.  This vnum is
very useful for loading. Vnum skill returns the skill number (for set) and
the slot number (for making new zones) of a skill name. Vnum area lists
all areas and their range of vnums.
(see also load)
~
152 STAT~

Syntax: stat <name>
	stat mob  <name>
	stat obj  <name>
	stat room <number>

The stat command gives you detailed information on an object, mobile, or room
within the game.  Without a class argument, the command will return a object
(if found), a mobile (if no object exists, but a mobile does), or a room 
(if a number is  given).  Stat room with no argument stats the room you are
standing in.  Stat can be used to find room vnums for goto.
(see also goto, transfer)
~
156 GUILD CLEAD~

Syntax: guild <char> <cln name>   Puts a player in a clan.

~
152 POOFIN POOFOUT~

Syntax: poofin  <message>
Syntax: pooffout <message>

'leaves in a swirling mist'.  You can replace these messages with messages of
your own choosing using the poofin and poofout commands.  These messages
must include your name somewhere in the string.

Poofin and poofout only show to characters who can see you.
(see also goto)
~
161 PROTECT~

Syntax: protect <character>

Protect is used to protect a character from unwanted snooping.  Removing 
protected status from a character WILL be seen by that character.

159 LOG SNOOP~

Syntax: log   <character>
	log   all
	snoop <character>

Log <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like Freeze, it is a permanent character toggle.
Logs may only be used by creators and implementors, and should be accompanied
by mail to the implementors.

Certain commands (Password) are protected against log.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

Log all logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots. Please do not use this unless you tell the imps.

Snoop shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time. Try to respect privacy.

Snoop yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.

request a quest from a questmaster, etc. Commands are as follows:

QUEST POINTS - Gives your current number of quest points. This command
mayh be used anywhere.

QUEST INFO - If you are on a quest, this will remind you who or what you
are after.

QUEST TIME - Gives the amount of time remaining on your current quest, or
the amount of time until you can request another quest. This command may
be used anywhere.

QUEST REQUEST - Petitions the questmaster to send you on a quest. If you
accept the quest, you will be given a realtime limit (in minutes) in
which you must complete the quest. If you are on a quest to kill a
creature, when you come across that creature you will see a [TARGET]
notice before it. This is the creature you are to kill.

QUEST COMPLETE - Once you have completed your quest and recovered the item
or killed the mob or whatever. you must return to the questmaster who sent
you on the quest and use this command. If you have successfully completed
your quest, he will reward you with gold and quest points. once you
complete a quest you cannot request another for 10 minutes (real time).

QUEST LIST - Displays the list of fabulous items for sale by the
questmaster. These items are not ableto be bought with gold. They must be purchased
with quest points.

cost of the item from your quest points.

{xSyntax: {Gstance{g               (to relax the stance){x

In combat, the stance of the fighter plays a very important role; you 
can't just stand there and exchange blow for blow unless you are very 
confident of your ability.  Each fighting stance has advantages and 
disadvantages, the basic outline of which follows:

{GVIPER : {gA very fast and aggressive style of combat, concentrating 
{g        on striking your opponent before they have the chance to 
{g        avoid or block you.
{GCRANE : {gA wide, sweeping style of combat, which concentrates on a 
{g        very strong blocking defence.
{GCRAB :  {gA low, defensive fighting stance which uses agile footwork 
{g        and rolling with attacks in order to reduce your injuries.
{GMONGOOSE: {gA light-footed stance which relies on leaps and acrobatics 
{g          to ensure that by the time your opponent makes their 
{g          attack, you've moved out of the way.
{GBULL :  {gA low aggressive stance which concentrates purely on 
{g        physical power.

{xOnce you are in a stance, you can type '{Gsskill{x' to see how skilled

you are in that particular stance and what your percentage is.  This 
only works when you are in that stance.

two normal stances.  These stances are much better than the others.

{c         counter attacks.

{c         uses very powerful attacks, as well as protecting the fighter 
{c         from injury.
{CTIGER :  {cRequires {CBULL {cand {CVIPER {cbefore it can be learned.  Probably 
{c         the most aggressive of all the stances, this style utilizes 
{c         very powerful and lightning fast attacks.
{CMONKEY : {cRequires {CCRANE {cand {CMONGOOSE {cbefore it can be learned.  The 
{c         only affect of this stance is to completely nullify the 
{c         advantages of your opponents stance.
{CSWALLOW: {cRequires {CMONGOOSE {cand {CCRAB {cbefore it can be learned.  This 
{c         is the most defensive of all the stances, combining agile

-1 DWARF DWARVES~

{x
Dwarves are short, stocky demi-humans, known for foul temper and great
stamina.  Dwarves have high strength and constitution, but poor dexterity.
They are not as smart as humans, but are usually wiser due to their long 
lifespans.  Dwarves make excellent fighters and priests, but are very poor
mages or thieves.  Dwarves are extremely resistant to poison and disease, 
but cannot swim so are vulnerable to drowning.  They receive the berserk 
skill for free (if warriors), and can see in the dark with infravision.

-1 ELF ELVES~

{x
Elves are slightly taller than humans, but have a much lighter build.  They
lack the strength and stamina of the other races, but are far more agile,
both in body and mind.  Elves are superb mages and thieves, but have at
best fair talent as warriors or priests.  Elves resist charm spells most 
effectively, due to their magical nature.  However, they are burned by the 
touch of iron, and so are barred from the use of iron or steel in their 
adventuring careers.  Elves are notoriously hard to spot, and so elven 
warriors and thieves receive the sneak and hiding automatically.  They can 
also see in the dark pretty well.

-1 GIANT GIANTS~

{x
Giants are the largest of the races, ranging from 9-12 feet in height.  They
are stronger than any other race, and almost as durable as the dwarves.  
They aren't too bright, however, and their huge size makes them more clumsy
than the other races.  Giants make the best warriors and are ill-suited at 
any other profession.  Giants resist heat and cold with nary a mark, due to
their huge mass.  However, their slow minds make them extremely vulnerable 
to mental attacks.  They are also pretty hopeless at avoiding lightning
strikes and are therefore vulnerable to them.  Due to their size and 
stamina, they receive the fast healing and bash skills for free.

-1 PIXIE PIXIES~

{x
Pixies are very much like the elves...and share with them a vulnerability
to iron weapons.  They also share the nature-loving attitude and peaceful
demeanor, but beyond this pixies reach an extreme.  They are extremely
magical creatures which, unlike elves, fly everywhere they go.  Their
wings are fairly redundant, as they don't really use them to fly.  It's
the sheer magical nature of a pixie that gives it its special qualities.
They are a race of very small size, and because of their inquisitive
nature and mental power, tend also to be tinkerers and sometimes
pranksters.  Because of this they are resistant to mental energies and
also resist the efforts of would-be charmers.  While a pixie may be 
thousands of years old, almost all of them act like human children...

-1 HALFLING HALFLINGS~

{x
Halflings are a quiet folk who like to keep to themselves and are not
often seen filling the role of an adventurer.  They would much rather
sit complacently by a fireplace enjoying a good book, good drink and
good conversation.  They are, however, very adept thieves, and have the
mental capabilities to be quite powerful mages.  They are about half
as tall as the average human, thus the name halfling.  Because of this
small size and the fact that most devices are built to human proportions,
halflings are masters at lockpicking, disarming traps and jewel craft.
They also have very easy access to pockets, and there is no door a
halfling can not open and slip through with the utmost of silence.  Due
to this sneaky nature, halflings are endowed with sneak and hiding 
abilities.  They resist poison and disease but are vulnerable to light.

-1 HALFORC HALFORCS~

{x
Halforcs are a cross between humans and orcs, dwarves and orcs, or sometimes
even giants and orcs.  These various combinations are almost always the result
of an orc raid on the habitation of one of those other races, and each type of
halforc is just as mean and hearty as the other.  They are also very agile,
and born athletes, however seldom is a halforc found that can even read or
speak coherently and due to this they are vulnerable to mental attacks.  They 
are quite literally dumber than bricks, but there is no more fearsome fighter 
around.  A halforc is a warrior and if a halforc is not a warrior, then that 
halforc is useless.  They can fight, and when it suits them they can also 
sleep, eat and fornicate, but that's it.

-1 GOBLIN GOBLINS~

{x
Goblins are almost universally shunned because they are almost all natural
criminals, cutthroats and killers.  Every crime boss or thief master is a
goblin, with very few exceptions.  They are extremely thrifty, known to
argue over a single silver piece, and will drop water in the desert before
dropping money.  Goblins have diabolical minds and few torture devices can
be named which a goblin did not think up.  They are extremely smart and also
have a knack for survival.  Stealth comes naturally to them, and their dusky
grey to green, sometimes even blue or black, skin tones make them hard to
spot at night.  They resist mental attacks but are vulnerable to silver,
light, wooden and holy items.  Goblins are not really warlike, and don't 
really appreciate overt combat.  It is not their style.  A goblin would 
much rather satisfy its sadistic needs through thievery or betrayal than 
through honorable combat.

{x
Halfelves are a cross between a human and an elf, usually due to the fact
that human armies sometime make raids on elf lands. Halfelves are very
nearly human, although they tend to be a bit more thoughtful and less
physically powerful.  Unfortunately they are also more bitter, and much
more aloof than either the most secretive elf or the most secluded human
hermit.  They see themselves as unwelcome in either elf or human society
and as a result tend to lead solitary lives as wandering adventurers who
follow no real creed.  A halfelf is a natural loner, and most of them are 
rangers or druids, communing with the nature that they love much as the 
elves do.  They have much better eyesight than humans, due to their elven 
ancestry, but unlike elves, are more inquisitive about the world around 
them, much as humans are.

-1 AVIAN AVIANS~

{x
The avian race is a very secretive and mysterious one.  They are the size
of giants, towering over any human, but weigh about the same as an elf.
Their slight bone structure allows their wings to carry them as they fly
from place to place, but it also requires them to rely on mental prowess
instead of brawn for survival.  Their adeptness in the air makes them 
resistant to lightning attacks as they 'bounce' off the aura around them.
Many speculate the avians are a people who evolved in the mountains, 
perhaps magically.  However they came to be, they are fiercely religious 
and worship a nature deity.  Most choose to become druids since that 
allows them to be closest to their god, however they do well in clerical 
magicks as well.  They have uncanny powers of sight and it is said that 
an avian can see everything you do.  Their amazingly unusual bodies, which
basically look like emaciated humans with wings and the fact that they
are used to an isolated environment, makes them very susceptible to
disease and poison.  Many an avian has ventured out of his or her
homeland only to fall victim to one of the many plagues that ravage the
world at large.

{x
Gnomes are to dwarves what pixies are to elves.  That is to say, they are
smaller, smarter, less-strong cousins.  Where dwarves are known for their
mental dullness but great wisdom, gnomes are known for quick minds and a
very analytical nature.  They are nowhere near as strong or hearty as
dwarves are, but are much the same, being creatures of earth who can't
swim (and thus drown easily like dwarves) and have eyes attuned to seeing
in the dark.  Where a dwarf would see a mine shaft and its glittering
jewels, though, a gnome notices the girders and struts and supports within
the mine and contemplates ways to make them better.  Gnomes love technology,
metallurgy and any other form of science.  This makes them natural mages,
possessing mental powers that rival elves.  They are not, however, a stealthy
race like elves, goblins, or halflings.  They are engineers, architects,
artisans, and sometimes workers of great magicks.

-1 DRACONIAN DRACONIANS~

The draconians are a fearsome race, and almost as secretive as the avians.
Like the avians, they can fly, and come from some not-so-well-known place
far away.  Unlike any other race though, draconians are not mammalian.
They more closely resemble lizards, snakes and especially dragons.
They tower over even giants in size, reaching over 12 feet in height, with
leathery wings that can stretch to over 30 feet when extended and can fold
up neatly on the back, causing no real hindrance in movement.  The sheer
size of a draconian DOES, however, cause problems, because most things in
the world are built with human size in mind.  Draconians are very strong,
and tougher even than dwarves.  Unlike most races that reach such large
proportions, they retain a keen mind and make good mages as well as
warriors.  Because of their strange biology, and some degree of reptilian
nature, draconians are immune to almost all poisons and plagues however
they are vulnerable to slashing and piercing weapons and also they dislike
lightning attacks.  They are, however, resistant to fire and cold.

greenish grey skin, darker near the muzzle, with a short reddish grey to

is little more than tattered rags.  These strange creatures are able to
see tantalizingly well in the dark and due to their undead nature, are
immune to all negative forms of energy, poison and disease.  They are
able to resist all weapon attacks and are born with a second attack.  
They are, however, vulnerable to all silver and holy items and they

The wings are usually folded across the back and may be mistaken at a
distance for a very large backpack.  Height ranges from 5 to 7 feet.
The feathers are predominantly brown with white underfeathers and face
markings.  The eyes are a brilliant yellow.  Due to their likeness to
hawks, they have keen eyesight.  They also have a good resistance to cold.

Minotaurs are huge, well over 7 feet tall, and quite broad and muscular.
They have the head of a bull but the body of a human male.  Their fur is
brown to black while their body colouring varies as would a normal human's.
Clothing is minimal, usually a loin cloth or skirt.  These large creatures
are immune to poison but vulnerable to blunt attacks.  They possess a
sharp eyesight and are also born with a natural ability for fighting.

surmounted by two sharp horns that poke through the satyr's coarse, curly
hair.  The skin of the upper body ranges from tan to light brown with rare
individuals (1%) with red skin.  A satyr's hair is medium reddish, or dark
brown.  The horns and hooves are black.  Satyrs living near centaurs are
likely to be friendly with them.  Satyrs have keen eyesight and can detect
hidden creatures with ease.  They can also detect good and evil auras.
Satyrs are immune to fire but vulnerable to holy items and don't like the
light.  They resist negative energies completely.

themselves seem beautiful and overpowering.  Titans are very close to nature.
They also have keen eyesight and can detect items which can not be seen
with the naked eye.  They are quite immune to charm and resist the effects
of weapons against them, yet they have quite a powerful temper when roused.
They do, however, heal quicker than most.

of the darkness of their homes, drow can see exceptionally well in the

hidden, within rooms.  Theiwar are a magical race, and it is said that they
are well schooled in the realm of combat magicks.  Theiwars are an evil 
race, made so by the harshness of the underground tunnels in which they 
live, and are thus resistant to magic of evil design and cold but quite

that demons are highly proficient in backstabbing and combat magics.  They 
are relatively strong and very intelligent.  Demons are also very agile and 
tend to stay incredibly healthy through their long lives.  Demons can see 
very well in the night and are constantly able to pass through solid objects.  
Because demons are magical creatures, they resist magic.  Since they are also 
incredibly evil, they are resistant to negative magic.  However, the light of 
day can hurt them greatly and any holy item would do a demon great harm.

Valkyries are the angels of the land.  Descended from Heaven, valkyries are

are always flying.  Because the air is on their cuts, they always heal
incredibly fast.  Valkyries are inherently good beings and seek to do good 
always.  They can cure any ailment, heal a person of any damage and protect 
a person from taking more damage.  These angelic creatures are resistant to 
charm and holy weapons do very little to them, since they themselves are 
holy, just as light does them little harm, as Heaven is the brightest of 
places.  However, Valkyries take great harm from magic and can't stand 
anything that is evil, thus they take a lot of damage from negative attacks.

-1 WRAITH~

{x
Wraiths are magical, undead creatures.  When seen, a wraith seems 
insubstantial, much like a wisp of smoke.  Because of this enchantment, 
wraiths can easily pass through any solid object and due to this,  
wraiths can steal from almost anyone.  However, this race have learned
that being able to see everything is an important skill and have 
therefore taught themselves detection magic.  Wraiths, while not being 
very strong, are highly intelligent and dextrous creatures.  And because 
they are intangible, they are constantly floating above the ground.   
Wraiths also take very little damage from weapons and are completely 
unaffected by cold or acid.  However, wraiths are malicious creatures 
and therefore take great damage from holy attacks.  Light can do them 
great harm, as well as can magic.

-1 STUN~

..
Stun works through bash.  Every time a warrior, with stun, bashes, he has a 1 in 5 chance of
stunning the victim.  Every successful stun has a 1 in 5 chance of lasting two round, otherwise
it will last two round.  A stunned player or mob can not parry, dodge or shield block, get any of
his attacks, or cast any spells during the time that they are stunned.
~
-1 Gouge~

Gouge is a bit of dirty fighting practiced by some classes.  When used,
you will attempt to jab at the eyes of your victim.  A successful hit will
temporarily blind your target.  
~
-1 STRIDER 'STRIDER BASICS' 'STRIDER DEFAULT'~

Striders are the 2nd tier version of Rangers, masters of the hunt.
They have a blend of Gladiator and Sage skills with the ability to
Ambush.  Since they aren't as adept as warriors when it comes to
fighting and Sages when it comes to using magic, the skills and spells
tend to be expensive.  Striders naturally receive the ability to use a
dagger and also get second attack for nothing.  At level 50 or so they
receive the ability to levitate shields, freeing both hands for
weapons.  

Strider default includes:

weapons master - the art of combat with all weapons
parry - the art of avoiding blows  
envenom - the ability to poison a weapon or another item
kick - a non-magical extra attack
third attack - the ability to get 3 hits in one round
enhanced damage - multiplies damage in battle
hand to hand - the ability to fight without a weapon
Beguiling - mental attack spells
curative - the ability to cure diseases, blindness and poison
healing - spells that replenish health and movement
protective - protective spells coupled with spells that dispel the
{x  magic on others 
transportation - the ability to freely move objects, others, and yourself from place to place
~
-1 ROOMS~

Clan Room may be bought using cubics, see 'help prices' for a list of
the prices.  Only one clan room within an organization may be set as
a healing room. The price quoted for the mana/heal option will set BOTH
up to 200%, which is the max.  A clan may only have 1 healer, 1 guard
and 1 storekeeper.

Healers are the same THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE GAME, so DO NOT ask that
your healers prices be lowered!

Only clan leaders may make a request for additional rooms/eq/etc...
What we need from you when you request a clan item:
    Mobiles:
            Job of the Mobile (healer/store etc.)
            Name of the mobile
            Description of the mobile
    Equipment:
            Name of the original piece of equipment
            New name for the eq
            New description for the eq
    Rooms:
            Name of room
            A full description of the room

You have the option of selecting the (approximate) location for the
entrance to your clan rooms.  The entrance cannot be within the immediate
Midgaard area, nor too close to another clans entrance.  A backdoor (a
one-way portal) is placed in your original clan room, this leads to
somewhere in Midgaard chosen by us at random (you have no say in where
this comes out).

Clans with a large number of rooms will be given consideration for having
more than one entrance to their area in different areas of the realms.

When making room descriptions, do not add your or any other player's names 
to it. (The only names that are allowed to appear in a room description are 
those of the Founders, or perhaps legendary players that are not here anymore 
that somehow distinguished themselves).

When making clan items, do not ask the IMMs to copy items from other areas 
and make them appear in your clan. If you wan an original item, CREATE it. 
Copying from another area is simply stealing from it, not to mention helping
to make the mud crash.
~
-1 WANDS STAVES SCROLLS~

Magical items require training to use properly.  If your character lacks the
necessary skill to use an item, he will fail, possibly destroying it.  The
item skills are as follows:

scrolls		The reading of magical scrolls and books (see 'help recite')
staves		The use of staves and similar devices (see 'help brandish')
wands		The use of wands and similar items (see 'help zap') 
~

-1 'GROUPS' 'INFO' 'PREMISE'~

The Redemption skill system allows you to fully customize your new character, making
him or her skilled in the skills you choose.  New skills can be gained at a
later date with your guildmaster.  Skills are paid for with creation points, 
and the more creation points you have, the harder it is to gain a level.  
Furthermore, higher-cost skills are harder to practice.

Skill groups are like package deals for characters -- sets of skills or spells
that are closely related, and hence can be learned as a unit.  There is a 
default skill group for each class, which can be selected for a balanced 
selection of skills at a somewhat reduced cost.

The experience breakdown is as follows: (for a human)
points   exp/level     points   exp/level
40        1000         90        6000
50        1500         100       8000
60	      2000         110      12000
70        3000         120      16000 
80        4000         130      24000
The table continues in a similar manner for higher point totals.

staves		use of magical staves

~
-1 MAGE 'MAGIC-USER' 'MAGE BASICS' 'MAGE DEFAULT'~

Mages specialize in the casting of spells, offensive ones in particular.
Mages have the highest-powered magic of any class, and are the only classes
able to use the draconian and enchanting spell groups.  They are also very
skilled at the use of magical items, though their combat skills are the 
weakest of any class.

All mages have the power to levitate a shield in front of them, freeing
both hands for weapons.

All mages begin with skill in the dagger. Any other weapon skills must be
purchased, at a very high rate.  The default skill selection for mages is

protective	defensive magics, ranging from armor to stone skin
transporation	spells for getting from here to there
weather		spells for conjuring and mastering the elements
~
-1 CLERIC 'CLERIC BASICS' 'CLERIC DEFAULT'~

Clerics are the most defensively orientated of all the classes.  Most of their
spells focus on healing or defending the faithful, with their few combat spells
being far less powerful than those of mages. However, clerics are the best 
class by far at healing magics, and they posess an impressive area of
protective magics, as well as fair combat prowess.

Clerics recieve the power to levitate a shield in front of them once they
reach level 50, freeing both hands for weapons.

All clerics begin with skill in the mace.  Other weapon or shield skills must
be purchased, many at a very dear cost.  The default skill selection for 
clerics is as follows:

weather         spells for conjuring and mastering the elements
~
-1 THIEF 'THIEF BASICS' 'THIEF DEFAULT'~

Thieves are a marginal class. They do few things better than any other class,
but have the widest range of skills available.  Thieves are specialists at
thievery and covert actions, being capable of entering areas undetected where
more powerful adventurers would fear to tread.  They are better fighters than
clerics, but lack the wide weapon selection of warriors.

All thieves begin with the dagger combat skill, and are learned in steal as 
well.  Any other weapon skills must be purchased, unless the default selection
is chosen.  This default skill package includes:

skills:
mace		the use of maces and other blunt weapons

pick lock	a useful skill for breaking and entering
sneak		with this skill, a thief can walk into a room undetected
~
-1 WARRIOR 'WARRIOR BASICS' 'WARRIOR DEFAULT'~

Warriors live for combat and the thrill of battle. They are the best fighters
of all the classes, but lack the subtle skills of thieves and the magical
talents of mages and priests.  Warriors are best for those who don't mind
taking the direct approach, even when another method might be called for.

Warriors begin with skill in the sword, and gain a second attack in combat.
Other weapon skills may be purchased cheaply, or gained in the default skill
package, which includes the following:

skills:

third attack	allows the skilled warrior to land three blows in one round
~
-1 RANGER 'RANGER BASICS' 'RANGER DEFAULT'~

Rangers are travelling warrior-druids, usually solitary and aloof.  They
are often the protectors of those far from home, travellers who are lost,
or even bounty hunters who track criminals in order to bring them to
justice or just to make a buck.  They are sometimes used as scouts for
armies, and sometimes make up their own force in times of war.

Rangers don't have the pure combat effectiveness of warriors, and lack
the total control of druidic magic that druids possess, but the combination
of those disciplines makes them a class to be reckoned with.

skills:
backstab        the art of hitting your opponent by surprise
enhanced damage this skill multiplies your damage in battle
parry           the art of parrying with weapons
sharpen         the art of honing you weapons
shield block    the art of parrying with a shield
weaponsmaster   this group provides knowledge of all weapon types

spell groups:

transportation  spells for getting from here to there
weather         spells for conjuring and mastering the elements
~
-1 DRUID 'DRUID BASICS' 'DRUID DEFAULT'~

Druids are the protectors of nature.  Some spend their lives in forests,
others in deserts, and some still in seas or mountainous regions.  Where
a druid can be closer to nature and life than to the constructs of mortals,
that druid can be happy.

They control a very powerful blend of magic, potent healing spells with
devastating combat spells, but they don't have transportation spells, as
druids are not wont to travel.  They aren't always well suited for it.

skills:
lore            the lore of magical items
second attack   with training, the skilled druid can hit twice as fast
sharpen         the art of honing weapons sharpen for more damage
shield block    the art of parrying with a shield
sneak           with this skill, a druid can walk into a room undetected

healing         spells for treating wounds, from scratches to death blows
protective      defensive magics, including the powerful sanctuary spell
weather         spells for conjuring and mastering the elements
~
-1 VAMPIRE 'VAMPIRE BASICS' 'VAMPIRE DEFAULT'~

Vampires are killers.  They aren't truly alive in the sense that most
mortals are, but are rather undead, not really subject to whithering of
old age or the fading of the mind that those who are truly alive find
themselves subject to.  As a result vampires are long lived, and almost
all of them eventually go insane.  They are very much like thieves, but
possess very potent powers of magic.

Vampires are not really a class in the traditional since, as many don't
choose to be what they are, and their powers are not the result of education
and training, but of undead nature.

skills:
backstab        the art of hitting your opponent by surprise
disarm          used to deprive your opponent of his weapon
dodge           the best way to take a punch is not to be there
shield block    the art of parrying with a shield
sneak           with this skill, a vampire can walk into a room undetected

spell groups:
beguiling       spells that control the mind
detection       informational magics, such as detect magic and identify
enhancement     spells that maximize physical potential, such as haste
illusion        magics for concealing and deceiving
maladictions    a selection of curses fit for any witch
transportation  spells for getting from here to there
~
-1 WIZARD 'WIZARD BASICS' 'WIZARD DEFAULT'~

..{&Wizards are the 2nd tier version of Mages, the masters of offensive,
illusion and enchantment magics.  Due to their bookish nature, Wizards
tend to be weak in in the ways of weapon and hand to hand combat and

staves and wands.

~
-1 PRIEST 'PRIEST BASICS' 'PRIEST DEFAULT'~

..{%Priests are the 2nd tier version of Clerics, the masters of protective
and healing spells.  Priests are often coveted by groups for their
ability to heal others and themselves.  Priests are also fair in the
ways of fighting with weapons.  They can be impressive with attack
spells, but still don't match the ability of a Wizard.  Priests at
level 40 can levitate shields.

~
-1 GLADIATOR 'GLADIATOR BASICS' 'GLADIATOR DEFAULT'~

..{&Gladiator is the 2nd tier version of a Warrior, the most straight
forward and brutal of the classes.

Though Gladiators can use magic, the spell classes are very expensive
and spells take a lot of practices to learn.  Not to mention the mana
of a Gladiator is minimal.

A Gladiator's default weapon is a sword and other weapon skills are
easily obtained.  Gladiators also get bash, 2nd attack, scrolls,
staves and wands.

~
-1 STRIDER 'STRIDER BASICS' 'STRIDER DEFAULT'~

..{&Striders are the 2nd tier version of Rangers, masters of the hunt.
They have a blend of Gladiator and Sage skills with the ability to
ambush.  Since they aren't as adept as warriors when it comes to
fighting and Sages when it comes to using magic, the skills and spells
tend to be expensive.  Striders naturally receive the ability to use a
dagger and also get second attack for nothing.  At level 50 or so they
receive the ability to levitate shields, freeing both hands for
weapons.

-1 SAGE 'SAGE BASICS' 'SAGE DEFAULT'~

..{&Sages are the 2nd tier version of Druids, masters of the elements.
They have a good mix of healing, protective and attack spells, but
aren't quite as adept as Priests and Wizards at their respective
trades.  Sages are however better suited for combat than their fellow
magic users.

default weapon, polearm.  Other weapon skills are obtained at a very
reasonable cost.

..{&Liches are the 2nd tier answer to the vampire class, the undead
masters of mind control.  Liches hold the ability to drink blood to
revive themselves, thus not needing any kind of heal spells.  Vampires

~
-1 EXOTIC WEAPONS WEAPON WEAPONSMASTER AXE DAGGER FLAIL MACE POLEARM SPEAR SWORD WHIP~

Each weapon skill applies to a specific group of armaments, and determines how
well a character fights with a particular weapon.  The weaponsmaster group
provides talent in all weapons (save exotics), from chair legs to halberds.
If the character has the parry skill as well, he can parry incoming attacks.
The chance of parrying is best if the character in question is skilled at 
both his weapon and his opponent's.

This spell will transport an obj from your inventory to the inventory of
another player.  You can turn off the ability to receive transports using
the notran command.
~
-1 'SHIELD BLOCK'~

Shield block is a rather fancy name for the art of parrying with a shield.
Characters with no shield block skill will not be able to defend themselves
well with a shield.  All classes may learn shield block, but only warriors and
clerics are good at it.  Beware, flails ignore shield blocking attempts, and
whips have an easier time getting around them.  Axes may split shields in two.
~
-1 ATTACK~

The attack spells are essentially powerful curses, fueled by divine energy
rather than magical power (like the combat spells are). They are less powerful
than the combat spells, but can still deal out a stinging blow.  Mages and

following spells:

These sorcerous spells are, in the words of one famous mage, just 'more ways to
toss energy around'.  They are the most powerful of the damaging spells, and

scry out the true nature of your foe.  All classes except warriors and thieves 
can use detection spells.

detect evil	reveals the aura of evil monsters
detect good	similar to above, only for good monsters
detect hidden	shows the whereabouts of hidden foes
detect invis	allows the caster to see the unseeable
detect magic	reveals magical auras to the caster
detect poison	determines if food is safe to eat
farsight	searches for living beings near the caster
identify	gives information about the nature of an object
know alignment	determines the moral character of a monster or person
locate object	finds a specific item
~
-1 DRACONIAN~

The Draconian spell group deals with the magic of dragons -- in this case, 
bringing forth the devastating power of their breath weapons upon your foes.
Only mages have the mental training necessary to cast these spells, and few
of them ever reach the level of mastery required to use them.

acid breath	 uses the black dragon's attack upon an enemy
fire breath	 calls forth the flames of a red dragon
frost breath	 drains the life from a foe with the power a white dragon
gas breath	 suffocates your enemies with poison gas
lightning breath summons the electrical fury of a blue dragon 
~
-1 ENCHANTMENT~

The enchantment spell group is used to imbue items with magical properties.
Currently, this spell group consists of enchant weapon and enchant armor, 
although more will be added in the future.  Only spell casters may enchant.

enchant weapon	increases the hit and damage bonuses of a weapon
enchant armor	increases the protective value of armor
fireproof       shields items from the harmful effects of fire and acid
recharge	restores power to a depleted wand or staff
~
-1 ENHANCEMENT~

The enhancement spells improve upon the body's potential, allowing feats of
superhuman strength and speed.  However, these spells may often have harmful
effects upon the recipient.

giant strength	grants increased strength
haste		doubles the speed of the target, but slows down healing
infravision	allows monsters to be seen in the dark
refresh		restores energy to tired adventurers
~
-1 HARMFUL~

This spell group is the opposite of healing.  The harmful spells are designed
to tear flesh from bone, rupture arteries, and generally turn the body against
itself.  Only spell casters may use this spell group.
In order of power, the harmful spells are:

cause light	inflicts minor wounds on an enemy
cause serious	inflicts wounds on a foe
cause critical  causes major damage to the target
harm		the most deadly harmful spell
~
-1 HEALING~

The healing spells are used to cure the wounds that adventurers inevitably
suffer in battle.  For curing other conditions, such as poison, see the
curative spell group.  Only spell casters have access to this group.
In order of power, the healing spells are:

cure light	heals minor wounds
refresh		restores vigor to a tired adventurer
cure serious	heals wounds
cure critical	closes all but the worst wounds
heal		the most powerful healing spell
mass healing	casts a heal spell on each player in the room
~
-1 ILLUSION~

The illusions spells are dedicated to deception and trickery.  They can be
used to mask appearances, or create distractions for the party.  
Only spell casters can cast illusion spells, which consist of the 
following:

invis		turns the target invisible
mass invis	turns the caster's group invisible
ventriloquate	allows the caster to put words in someone's mouth
dispel invis	dispels the invisibility on someone or something
prismatic spray an area-attack which launches beam attacks of many effects
~
-1 MALADICTIONS~

Maladictions are a group of curses and other baneful spells, designed to
cripple, inconvenience, or torture, rather than kill outright.  These spells
may be cast by most spell casters.

blindess	strikes the target blind
curse		prevents recalling and weakens the target in combat
energy drain	drains experience and mana, while strengthening the caster
plague		causes the target to suffer a slow, painful death from plague
poison		weaker than plague, but often fatal
slow		slows your enemies down, reducing their rate of attack	
weaken		drains the strength of the target
~
-1 PROTECTIVE~

The protective spells are used to shield against harm, whether from spells or
physical attack.  They range from the weak armor spell to the sought-after
sanctuary charm.  Also included in this group are several spells for dispeling
hostile magics. Most spell casters may use this group, which consists of the 
following spells:

armor		provides the target with an extra layer of defense
cancellation	a powerful dispel, used for removing spells from friends
dispel magic	removes spells from enemies, not as effective as cancel
fireproof	shields items from the harmful effects of fire and acid
protection evil	provides defense from the attacks of evil creatures
protection good protects from the attacks of good beings
sanctuary	reduces all damage taken by the recipient by half
shield		puts a shimmering shield between you and your enemies
stoneskin	turns skin hard as stone, providing a huge armor boost
~
-1 SHIELDING FIRESHIELD ICESHIELD SHOCKSHIELD HOLYSHIELD UNHOLYSHIELD~

These arcane and costly spells are only for the most learned of the ranks of
mages, clerics and druids wandering the land.  They require great amounts of 
energy and can be very devastating. They can only be cast on the caster.  The 
following spells are included in this group and are listed in order of strength:

        iceshield       surrounds caster with a thick shell of ice
        fireshield      surrounds caster with a flaming inferno
        shockshield     surrounds caster with a crackling sphere
        holyshield      surrounds caster with a holy shield (align based)
        unholyshield    surrounds caster with an unholy shield (align based)

The first 3 spells were coded by Kelson (Micah Bartell) for use with ROM based muds,
and are released under the GNU license.(use them, edit them, give me mention)
Questions and comments can be sent to micah@cse.unl.edu.
~
-1 TRANSPORTATION~

The transportation group is used for travel, whether by flight, magical
teleportation, or walking through walls.  All classes except warriors may 
learn some or all of these spells, which are among the most useful in the game.

fly		allows the target to fly over nearly all obstacles
gate		transports the caster to the target
nexus		forms a two-way portal to a far off destination
pass door	allows the caster to walk through walls
portal		creates a one-way portal to a destination
summon		transports the target to the caster
teleport	sends the target to a random location
transport	sends the target object to another player
shadow walk     the ability to walk the shadow plane (thieves & mercs)
~
-1 WEATHER~

These spells allow the caster to manipulate local weather conditions, as well
as summon fog clouds, lightning, or even electrical glows.  This group is
usable by all spell casters, but druids & sages gain the most benefit:

call lightning	  summons a huge bolt from the heavens, if the weather is right
faerie fire	  surrounds the target in a glowing aura (harming their AC)
faerie fog	  reveals all hidden creatures in the room
lightning bolt	  sends a bolt of electricity into the target
sleet		  sends a powerful force of rain & snow to damage the target
acid rain	  a heaven sent downpour of acid rain strikes the target
meteorswarm	  an extremely powerful two-fold area attack of meteors
water elemental	  a summoned creature of the water element to aid the caster
earth elemental	  a summoned creature of the earth element to aid the caster
lightning storm	  sends a two-blast attack of lightning onto the target
air elemental     a summoned creature of the air element to aid the caster
megafaerie fire   surrounds the target in a damaging aura (more so than regular)
fire elemental    a summoned creature of the fire element to aid the caster

(the weather command, unrelated to this group, shows local weather conditions)
~
-1 BACKSTAB~

Backstab is the favored attack of thieves, murderers and other rogues.  It 
can be used with any weapon type, but is most effective with piercing weapons.
The damage inflicted by a backstab is determined by the attacker's level, his
weapon skill, his backstab skill, and the power of his opponent.
Only thieves and vampires may learn the backstab.  (See ambush for rangers)
~
-1 BASH~

The bash skill is a warrior talent, a brute-force attack designed to knock
your foe to his knees.  Its success depends on many factors, including the
bash rating, your weight, and the size of your opponent.  Bashing a dragon
is not generally a wise idea.
~
-1 BERSERK~

Only powerful warriors can master berserking, the ability to enter insane rage
in combat.  Its effects are not altogether unlike the frenzy spell -- a huge
surge of combat prowess, coupled with a disregard for personal safety.  
Berserking warriors are more resistant to the effects of magic.
~
-1 DIRT 'DIRT KICKING'~

Consider by some to be a cowardly skill, dirt kicking gives the clever 
combatant a chance to blind his opponent by casting dirt into his eyes.  The
blindness does not last long, but can provide an edge in combat.  Dexterity
helps in hitting or avoiding a dirt kick.  
~
-1 DISARM~

Disarm is a somewhat showy and unreliable skill, designed to relieve your
opponent of his weapon.  The best possible chance of disarming occurs when you
are skilled both your own and your opponent's weapon. 
~
-1 DODGE~

In the words of one wise warrior, 'the best way to block a blow is to not
be where it lands'.  The dodge skill honors this tradition, by improving the
character's natural agility to the point where many blows will miss the 
target. The chance of dodging is also affected by the dexterity of the
attacker and the target.
~
-1 'ENHANCED DAMAGE'~

Most classes can become skilled enough in combat that they are
able to inflict more damage than other classes.  Enhanced damage is checked
for with each hit, although with a low skill, the chance of receiving a bonus
is very low indeed.
~
-1 ENVENOM~

The envenom skill is a cowardly skill designed to win a battle through 
alchemy and treachery rather than skill or strength.
Or, put another way, it's a skill used by the smart to kill the foolish.
Food, drink, and weapons may be envenomed, with varying effects. Poisoned
food or drink puts a mild poison spell on the consumer, and is unlikely to
be more than a minor inconvience (after all, the typical adventurer could
drink sewer water with only a trace of the runs).  A poisoned weapon, on
the other hand, can inflict serious damage on an opponent as the poison 
burns through his bloodstream.  But be careful, blade venom evaporates 
quickly and is rendered almost powerless by repeated blows in combat.
~
-1 'HAND TO HAND'~

Hand to hand combat is a rare skill in the lands of Midgaard.  Learning this
style of fighting gives the player a weapon even when disarmed -- bare hands.
Trained hand to hand experts are far more effective than many swordsmen.
~
-1 KICK~

Kicking allows the adventurer to receive an extra attack in combat, a powerful
kick. However, a failed kick may throw an unwary fighter off balance.  Fighters
and clerics are the most skilled at kicking, although thieves may also learn
it.
~
-1 PARRY~

If at first you fail to dodge, block it.  Parry is useful for deflecting 
attacks, and is succesful more often than dodge.  Parry requires a weapon for
full success, the hand-to-hand skill may also be used, but results in reduced
damage instead of no damage.  The best chance of parrying occurs when the
defender is skilled in both his and his opponent's weapon type.
~
-1 RESCUE~

A friend in need is a friend indeed.  And when in combat, a warrior with
the rescue skill is just the friend you need.  Rescue allows you to intercede
in combat, protecting weaker characters from bodily harm. Hopefully the
favor will be returned.  Success in rescuing depends on the skill rating, as
well as a comparision of level, dexterity, and speed between the character and
the target. (note: you rescue a friend, not the monster)
~
-1 TRIP~

Back by popular demand.  Trip is a somewhat dastardly attack, and involves
using any one of a number of methods to bring your opponent down to the ground.
Tripping large monsters is generally not a good idea, and agile ones will
find the attack easy to avoid.
~
-1 'SECOND ATTACK'~

Training in second attack allows the character a chance at additional strikes
in combat -- allow a 100% second attack does NOT guarantee 2 attacks every
round.  Any class may learn this skill.
~
-1 'THIRD ATTACK'~

Training in third attack allows the character a chance at an additional strike
in a combat, and increases the chance of a second attack as well.  Perfect
third attack does NOT assure three attacks per round.
~
-1 'FOURTH ATTACK'~

Training in fourth attack allows the character a chance at an additional strike
in a combat, and increases the chance of a third attack as well.  Perfect
fourth attack does NOT assure four attacks per round.
~
-1 'FIFTH ATTACK'~

Training in fifth attack allows the character a chance at an additional strike
in a combat, and increases the chance of a fourth attack as well.  Perfect
fifth attack does NOT assure five attacks per round.
~
-1 HIDE SNEAK~

Hide and sneak are similar skills, both related to remaining undetected.
Hide has a very high chance of success, but only works for as long as the
character remains stationary.  Sneak may be used when moving (including to
sneak by monsters), but has a lower chance of success.
~
-1 'FAST HEALING'~

The fast healing skill improves wound healing rates, whether walking, resting,
or sleeping. It represents knowledge of healing herbs or just general 
toughness and stamina.  Fast healing is checked every tick, and it is 
possible for it to fail.
~
-1 LORE~

Lore is a general skill, consisting of knowledge of myths and legends. Use
of the lore skill gives a chance of obtaining information on an object,
concerning its power and uses.  It also may occasionally increase the value
of an object, because more will be known about its worth.
~
-1 HAGGLE HAGGLING~

Haggling is an indispensable skill to the trader.  It allows a character to
match wits with a merchant, seeking to get a better price for merchandise,
or to buy at the lowest possible cost.  Unfortunately, most merchants are 
already very skilled at haggling, so the untrained adventurer had best 
guard his treasure closely.  Thieves are natural masters at haggling, 
although other classes may learn it as well.
~
-1 PEEK~

The peek skill is useful for seeing what a player or monster is carrying,
the better to use the steal command with.  More intelligent characters are
harder to peek at.  All characters may learn peek, but thieves are the most
common practicioners.
~
-1 PICK 'PICK LOCK'~

Lock picking is one of the prime skills of thieves, allowing them to gain
access to many secured areas.  Lock picking chances are improved by  
intelligence, and hindered by the difficulty of the lock. Other classes may
learn to pick locks, but they will never find it easy.
~
-1 MEDITATION~

This skill is similar to fast healing, but relies on the concentration and
mantras to increase mana recovery when the character is sleeping or resting.
Thieves and warriors, with their troubled minds and violent attitudes, have
much trouble learning to meditate.
~
-1 STEAL~

Theft is the defining skill of the thief, and is only available to that class.
It allows items to be stolen from the inventory of monsters and characters.
~
-1 'DETECT GOOD'~

Syntax: cast 'detect good'
 
This spell enables the caster to detect good characters, which will
reveal a characteristic golden aura.
~
-1 'DISPEL GOOD'~

Syntax: cast 'dispel good' <victim>
 
This spell invokes the wrath of Alys on a good victim. It can be very
dangerous for casters who are pure of heart.
~
-1 'RECHARGE'~

Syntax: cast 'recharge' <item>

The recharge spell is used to restore energy to depleted wands and staves.
Fully exhausted items cannot be recharged, and the difficulty of the spell
is proportional to the number of charges used.  Magic items can only be
recharged one time successfully.
~
-1 'DEMONFIRE'~

Syntax: cast 'demonfire' <target>

Demonfire is a spell of blackest evil, and as such can only be used by those
who follow the paths of darkness.  It conjures forth demonic spirits to 
inflict terrible wounds on the enemies of the caster.
~
-1 'RAY OF TRUTH'~

Syntax: cast 'ray of truth' <target>

Ray of truth opens a portal to the planes of positive energy, bringing forth
a beam of light of sufficient purity to harm or or annihilate the servants
of evil.  It cannot harm the pure of heart, and will turn and strike 
casters who are tainted by evil.
~
-1 'PORTAL'~

Syntax: cast 'portal' <target>

The portal spell is similar to gate, but creates a lasting one-way portal
to the target creature, instead of transporting the caster.  Portals are
entered using 'enter' or 'go' command, as in 'go portal'.  Portals cannot
be made to certain destinations, nor used to escape from gate-proof rooms.
Portal requires a special source of power to be used, unfortunately the
secret of this material component has been lost...
~
-1 'NEXUS'~

Syntax: cast 'nexus' <target>

This spell is virtually identical to portal (see 'help portal'), with the
only difference being that while portal creates a one-way gate, a nexus 
spell makes a two-sided gate.  It also lasts longer than the lower-powered
portal spell.  Both spells require an additional power source, the secret
of which has been lost...
~
-1 'HEAT METAL'~

Syntax: cast 'heat metal' <target>

Heat metal is a powerful clerical attack spell, with effects that vary 
according to the armor of the victim.  It heats up the metal equipment
(assumed to be all weapons and armor at this point in time) on the target,
causing him or her to drop them if possible, taking serious burns in the
process (possibly fatal if the equipment is too heavy to remove easily).
This spell does no damage to creatures who are immune to fire.
~
-1 'HOLY WORD'~

Syntax: cast 'holy word'

Holy word involves the invocation of the full power of a cleric's god, with
powerful blessings on the priest's allies.  All creatures of like alignment in the
room are blessed and filled with righteous divine wrath.  The cleric suffers
greatly from the strain of this spell, being left unable to move and 
drained of vitality.  Experience loss is no longer associated with the spell.
~
-1 FRENZY~

Syntax: cast 'frenzy' <target>

The frenzy spell fills the target with righteous fury, greatly increasing
his or her attack skill and damaging capacity.  Unfortunately, this divine
wrath is coupled with a tendency to ignore threats to personal safety, 
making the character easier to hit.  Frenzy provides immunity to the calm
spell (see 'help calm'), and may only be used on those of the caster's 
alignment.
~
-1 CALM~

Syntax: cast 'calm' 

One of the most useful and often overlooked abilities of the master cleric is
the calm spell, which can put an end to all violence in a room.  Calmed
creatures will not attack of their own volition, and are at a disadvantage
in combat as long as the spell soothes their minds.  The more violence 
activity there is in a room, the harder the spell, and it is all or nothing --
either all combat in the room is ended (with the exception of those who
are immune to magic) or none is.
~
-1 HASTE~

Syntax: cast 'haste' <target>

The haste spell increases the speed and agility of the recipient, allowing
an extra attack (or even a backstab) in combat, and improving evasive
abilities in combat.  However, it produces a great strain on the system,
such that recuperative abilities are halved.  Haste is capable of negating
the slow spell. (see 'help slow').
~
-1 SLOW~

Syntax: cast 'slow' <target>

Despite popular mythology, slow is not the opposite of haste, but is a spell
with it's own unique set of effects.  When cast on an unfortunate victim,
it slows its movements, making it easier to hit and reducing its rate
of attack.  The effect of slow also double movement costs and halve healing
rates, due to reduced metabolism.
~
-1 PLAGUE~

Syntax: cast 'plague' <target>

The plague spell infests the target with a magical disease of great virulence,
sapping its strength and causing horrific suffering, possibly leading to
death.  It is a risky spell to use, as the contagion can spread like
wildfire if the victim makes it to a populated area.
~
-1 'CREATE ROSE'~

Syntax: cast 'create rose'

A romantic spell that creates a fragrant red rose, with utterly no game
use whatsoever.
~
-1 'PROTECTION GOOD' 'PROTECTION EVIL'~

Syntax: cast 'protection evil' <target>
	cast 'protection good' <target>

The protection spells reduce damage taken from attackers of the appropriate
ethos, and improve saving throws against all forms of magic. They may not
be cast on others, and one person cannot carry both defenses at the same
time.
~
0 'GIANT STRENGTH'~

Syntax: cast 'giant strength' <character>
 
This spell increases the strength of the target character.
~
-1 'CHAIN LIGHTNING'~

Syntax : cast 'chain lightning' <target>

Chain lightning is a deadly spell, producing a powerful bolt of lightning
that arcs from target to target in the room, until its force is fully
expended.  Allies of the caster may be hit by this spell if they are members 
of a clan, while the caster himself will not be struck unless no other
viable target remains.  Chain lightning is most effective when used on
groups of creatures.
~
-1 SCAN FARSIGHT~

scan farsight
Syntax: scan
	scan <direction>
	cast 'farsight'

The scan command allows the user to detect movement in surrounding areas.

The farsight spell expands the caster's consciousness, allowing him or her
to see far away beings like they were in the same room.  It takes intense
concentration, often leaving the caster helpless for several minutes.
The spell may be used for a general scan that reaches a short distance in
all directions, or with a directional component to see creatures much
farther away.
~
-1 MASS HEALING~

Syntax: cast 'mass healing' 

The mass healing spell, as its name might suggest, performs a healing spell
on all players in the room.  It also throws in a refresh spell for good
measure.
~
-1 'FLOATING DISC'~

Syntax: cast 'floating disc'

This useful spell creates a floating field of force which follows the caster
around, allowing him or her to pile treasure high with no fear of weight
penalties.  It lasts no more than twice the casters level in hours, and
usually less.  It can hold 10 pounds per level of the caster, with a 
maximum of five pounds per item.  The spell requires an open float location
on the character, and the only way to remove the disc is to die or allow it
to run out of energy.
~
-1 FIREPROOF~

Syntax: cast 'fireproof' <object>

The fireproof spell creates a short-lived protective aura around an object,
to protect it from the harmful effects of acid and flame.  Items protected
by this spell are not harmed by acid, fire, or the heat metal spell.
Although inexpensive to use, the spell's short duration makes it impractical
for protecting large numbers of objects.
~
-1 ALIAS UNALIAS~

Syntax: alias
	alias <word>
	alias <word> <substitution>
	unalias <word>

The alias command allows limited shortening of command names.  At this time,
aliases cannot call other aliases, and cannot generate more than one command.
Alias by itself lists your current aliases, Alias <word> lists the alias with 
that name (if such exist), and alias with both a word and and argument 
produces a new alias.  You cannot alias either alias or unalias to a new
command.  Examples of use:

alias gc get all corpse --> typing gc will equal typing 'get all corpse'
alias ff cast 'fireball' --> ff orc will equal 'cast 'fireball' orc'

Only the first word on the line will be subsituted at this time.
~
-1 ROT~

RoT is a ROM2.4 derived mud, which is originally based on the Merc 1.0 code.
The RoT modifications to the ROM source are copyright 1996-1997 by Russ Walsh.
~
-1 ROM~

ROM started in early February 1993, using Merc 1.0 code. In July of 1993,  
ROM II was started, eventually replacing the original ROM.  ROM was up for
a little over a year, after which the code (version 2.3) was released,
and various other ROM muds were started, including Rivers of Mud under
a new management (Zump's ROM), at rom.org 9000.

Alander's current project is Tesseract, the latest version of the ROM code.
It can be found at hypercube.org 9000.

The following people contributed to the ROM flavor of the merc base code:

Socials --
    Kelsey and Liralen

New, Improved Valhalla --
    Liralen

Puff's new special proc and improved poofin/poofout code --
    Seth

Maps and map shop --
    Ezra, Regnan (Olympus)

Nirvana zone --
    Forstall (mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Mob Factory --
    Pinkfloyd (originally written for ROM, mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Geographically correct Midgaard (tm) --
    Alander

Ideas and playtesting --
    Thousands of dedicated mudders around the world

Beta testing --
    Ken Blosser, Doug Araya, and Sherene Neil all helped with bug reports
    and suggestions, saving a lot of headaches

New Thalos area was donated by Onivel of Jedi, who was also the originator
of the ASCII flags used in the zone files

ROM 2.4 was developed during my time with Moosehead mud, and the release
shares many of the features I wrote while I was there.  Additional code
was written by Seth Scott (the new poofin/poofout), and many contributions
and ideas from the Merc list were used. 

The new features of 2.4 were largely produced in bull sessions with
Gabrielle (my wife) and Brian Moore, without whom this release wouldn't
have happened.  In particular, the new privacy code, furniture, and
wiznet are largely the results of Gabrielle's ideas.

Changes to the standard diku mob and object format, as well as the changes
to Merc 2.1 source code, were done by Alander over many a late night of
hair-pulling. Hope you enjoy it.

(my apologies if anyone was forgotten in this list)
~
-1 IMMORTAL IMMORT GOD WIZARD WIZ~

'Immortal' (often, simply, 'immort') refers to players who have reached
the highest attainable levels in the game.  Here, anyone of level 152
or higher is an 'immortal.'  Immortals are capable of exceeding the
usual game rules, in more drastic and pervasive ways as levels increase;
examples range from teleportation and invisibility to mortal sight to
creation of objects, removal of a player's privileges (channels,
ability to move, or even ability to log in), and ability to promote
players to immortality.

Since immortals can wreak havoc with game balance, they are (ideally)
a carefully-chosen and policed group.  An absolute rule of immortal
behavior is that no immortal can aid or assist any player without
explicit permission from the higher ranks; in other words, please
don't ask an immortal to help you kill a mob, gather EQ, etc, or
you'll likely be either politely or rudely refused, or referred to
this file.

The duties of immortals, and even the very reasons for their existence,
are topics of continual and heated debate in various MUD forums, and are
fraught with misconceptions, poor examples, and outrageous hypocrisies. :)

-1 PKILL PKILLING PKILLER 'PLAYER KILLING' PSTEAL PSTEALING 'PLAYER STEALING'~

Player killing and player stealing are allowed to all PK clan members 
(including loners & exiles), provided the victim is within 10 levels below and 
15 levels above the character and is also in a clan. 

If you have never pkilled it is a good idea to learn more about it or join 
PKNEWBIES before joining a full PKILL clan.

See help pknewbies.
~
0 WARRULES ARENARULES TOURNAMENTRULES~

WAR:
* Rules of the war are the same as in pk.
* You can not use war to gain advantage in PK. (For example gating)
* If you are in a war you can not attack non-war player. 
* If you are in a war you CAN BE ATTACKED by a non-war player; it will be regular PK fight 
{x  (but your death might be just a war death, but might be regular, so be careful)
* Everything else goes (i.e., if its allowed in PK its allowed in a WAR) - so, again, be 
{x  careful, its not 100% safe.

TOURNAMENT
* You can not quaff/eat/drink/swallow/puff/zap/etc healing anything during the tournament. 
{x  (Only healing allowed is from casting spells and vampiric type skills)

ARENA
* No stealing in the arena.
* No heat metal.
* No disarming and taking the weapon. If you disarm, you MUST pick it up and give it back.
* You must be at least level 35 and within 25 levels of your opponent.
* Do not throw the fight for betting purposes.
~
0 SUICIDE DELETE~

Use the delete command to erase unwanted characters, so the name will be
available for use.  This command must be typed twice to delete a character,
and you cannot be forced to delete.  Typing delete with an argument will
return your character to 'safe' status if you change your mind after the
first delete.  Second tier players should use reroll to recreate a
character, instead of the delete command.
~
0 REROLL~

The reroll command may be used once you reach hero status in the first
tier of classes, or at any time while playing a second tier character.
This command must be typed twice to reroll a character, and you cannot
be forced to reroll.  Typing reroll with an argument will return your
character to 'safe' status if you change your mind after the first reroll.

After typing reroll the second time, you will be forced to quit.  When
you reconnect, you will have to re-create your character, but will be
given the second tier classes to choose from, instead of the first tier
classes. (see 'help tier')

After rerolling, you will start out in your new class at level 1, so
this command is similar to deleting and recreating your character.
~
0 TIER~

There are currently fourteen classes in Redemption, split into two tiers.
1st tier classes:
   {Mmage    cleric  thief      warrior    ranger   druid  vampire{x
2nd tier classes:
   {Rwizard  priest  mercenary  gladiator  strider  sage   lich{x

The second tier classes are notably stronger than the first tier
classes, but you cannot create a character in these classes until
you reach the hero level in a first tier class. (see 'help reroll')

You DO NOT have to choose the second tier class that is in the same
slot as the first tier class, ie: a mage does not have to become
a wizard, you are given the option of choosing any of the classes.
~
0 HEALER~

The healer decided to grab a quick buck, and now charges for his heals.  Some
services are free to players of all levels. To see a full listing of the 
healer's services, type 'heal' at his residence. To receive healing, bring 
plenty of money, and type 'heal <spell>'.
~
-1 GAIN~

The gain command is used to learn new skills, once the proper trainer has 
been found. (Check New Thalos) The following options can be used with gain:

gain list:    list all groups and skills that can be learned
gain points:  lower your creation points by 1 (costs two sessions)
gain <name>:  add a skill or skill group, at the listed cost
gain convert: turns 6 practices into one training session
gain study:   turns 1 training session into 6 practices

Gain uses training sessions, not practices. (see 'help train')
Gained skills and groups do NOT increase your experience per level or total
number of creation points. 
~
0 SKILLS SPELLS~

The skills and spells commands are used to display your character's list
of available skills (or spells, as the case may be).  They are listed in
order of level, with mana cost (for spells) or percentage (for skills)
listed where applicable.
~
0 AUTO AUTOALL AUTOLIST AUTOLOOT AUTOGOLD AUTOSAC AUTOEXIT AUTOASSIST AUTOSPLIT AUTOSTORE AUTOPEEK~

Redemption uses varies automatic actions, to ease the boredom of always splitting
gold and sacrificing corpses.  The commands are as follows:

autolist  : list all automatic actions
autoloot  : take all equipment from dead mobiles
autogold  : take all gold from dead mobiles
autosac	  : sacrifice dead monsters (if autoloot is on, only empty corpes)
autoexit  : display room exits upon entering a room
autosplit : split up spoils from combat among your group members
autoassist: makes you help group members in combat
autostore : saves all tells during combat
autopeek  : will show inventory during a look <char> (with the peek skill)
autoall   : turns all of the above options ON (except autopeek)

Typing a command sets the action , typing it again removes it. 
~
-1 CLAN~

A Clan is a collection of players, united to follow and further
a common cause.  Each clan has rules and regulations, to find out
more about clans and their 'beliefs' type "help <clan name>".  Only
PK Clan members can kill or steal from other players.  To join a Clan
you must be level 25 or above and level 110 or below.  Second tier
players may join a clan starting at level 15.  Speak to the Clan
Leader about joining.
   Joining a PK Clan is a dangerous step.  Many adventurers live to 
kill and torture others and chances are that your paths will cross.
   Clans may now choose to allow pkill or not, members of clans that
choose not to have pkill will be unable to attack other players, or
be attacked by others.
   Existing Clans may buy special rooms and mobiles by acquiring 
cubic zirconiums as payment.  To see room prices, type
"help prices".  New Clans may be formed by petitioning the immortals.
New Clans cost 300 cubic zirconiums to set up and include a healer,
shopkeeper, guard, couch, fountain, pit, and four rooms.
Please remember that their word is final on all matters not covered by
this help.

A list of current clans can be obtained with:  clan list
~
-1 PRICES PRICE~

New Clan Hall Rooms cost 25 cubic zirconiums.
Boosting the mana and healing gains for a room costs 30 cubic zirconiums.
Extra Mobiles cost 40 cubic zirconiums a piece.

Only cubic zirconiums bought from the jeweller in Midgaard may be used as
payment.

See 'help rooms' for information on ordering extra clan rooms/mobiles.

The count command displays the number of people (that you can see) logged
into the mud.  It also displays the highest number observed that day, if
it is higher.
~
-1 GATE~

The gate spell is a powerful transportation magic that opens up a portal 
between your character and another person or creature somewhere else in the
world.  This portal will transport you and any pet you might have, but not
other members of your group.  Monsters receive a save against gate, and
monster or players more than 3 levels higher than you can not be gated to at 
all.  God rooms, private rooms, and no recall rooms cannot be gated to, and
no recall rooms cannot be gated out of.  Finally, any god or hero is also 
immune to gate.
~
-1 AFFECTS AFFECT~

This command is used to show all the spells affecting your character. At
low levels, only the spell name will be displayed, at higher levels the
effects and duration of the spell will also be shown.  Spell effects
are no longer shown on score (this can be changed by using 'show' command).

0 AMRAGORNE~

{yAmragorne is the central area of the Land of Amragorne.  This dry dark
land is inhabited by many desert dwelling creatures, her human inhabitants
scarce.  The area is sealed once you enter the dark pass beneath the
mountains, passing the bloody wards.  {x

0 'CORAL REEF'~

{yThe Coral Reef is built to be an extension onto any "sea" or "ocean"...
Most likely somewhere near the coast.  Colorful descriptions and a maze-like
layout go hand in hand with a complete mob-prog driven quest.  The quest
itself seems to be fairly difficult, though finding the quest has stumped
many.  ;){x
