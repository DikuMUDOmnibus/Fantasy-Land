This gorgeous, blonde woman stands behind the counter awaiting your every
request.  Known for her outstanding beauty, only one person can match her. 
That person, is her twin sister Amber.  Warm hearted, and good natured,
Tawny is a friend to all.  Clearly loving her job, a bright smile always
dominates her cheerful face.  Although this lovely lady is caring and
compassionate, she's not one to be reckoned with.

{5The rich {#buttery {5scent of freshly sauteed mushrooms wafts through the
air, filling your nostrils with delight.  Tawny, the hostess of this
wonderful restaurant, smiles at you from behind the seemingly endless bar. 
Lined with mushroom shaped swivel stools, the {*black marble {5countertop
harmonizes perfectly.  {%Lavender {5pillows propped up in {3wicker chairs {5sit
around matching tables strategically placed around the room.  Meticulously
arranged vases full of Iris' and orchids sit on top of each table. 
Chandeliers adorned with flaming mushrooms dangle from above.  Although this
place may be classy, there is most definately a happy-go-lucky atmosphere. 
Hanging on each and every wall are pictures of {*E{7m{&i{*l{7y {5and {%R{5e{%i{5n{%a{5, the founders
of this heavenly abode.  {x

Runey's Romper Room~
Here you are in Runestar's room.  She's decorated according to her
tastes, so you're hit with a blast of color as a first impression. 
Two walls are covered with bookcases, filled with fantasy/SF books and
RPG sourcebooks.  The upper half of the walls (all free space) is
plastered with posters.  You spot Ranma-chan and Ranma-kun, the cast
of Tenchi Muyo, assorted comic book characters, and an Olivia poster. 
Hanging from the ceiling is a Ryo-oh-ki stuffed toy looking like a
furry, demented disco ball.
