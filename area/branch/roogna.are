The sound of a hammer upon an avil rings loudly in the air.  Sparks fly
randomly and the heat from the forge is intensely hot.  This can only be the
main smithy of Roogna.  Piles of armor and weapons are stacked and priced
against the main conter and barrows of raw iron and steel sit against the
east wall, ready to be turned into masterpieces of metalsmithing.

You have entered a small shrine to worship the demon X(A/N)th.  The demon
is not evil in the context of the word "demon" and is, in fact, a very
curious and neutral omnipotent being.  The shrine is constructed of obsidian
and gold leafing, with several candles lit at the corners.  A strange aura
of power surrounds this altar, but it is not a threatening aura.  You feel
rather relaxed here, and wonder what the priest that stands here does for
the visitors.

The Entrance to Castle Roogna~
You are standing before the large doors that lead into the grand Castle
Roogna.  The castle looks forebodingly huge from here, almost more a
fortress than a castle, although the current King has made steps towards
renovating it so that it appears more friendly.  The massive stone blocks
that make up this castle look impossibly heavy and solid and you can only
marvel at the engineering of labor that constructing this castle must have
taken.

here, yet the castle is furnished with tasteful and practical items.  The
elegant blue carpeting offsets the stunning green silk curtains that drape
about the windows.  A few torchplants are growing in bronze planters,
illuminating the room without danger of a real fire.  You feel at home and

brazier filled with perfumed oil burns in the center of the room upon a
large polished marble table.  There are a set of steps leading up from here.
