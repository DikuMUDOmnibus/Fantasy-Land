The Circle of Cahervaniel~
White shafts of stone thrust up from the earth, decayed and broken. 
Their circular arrangement at the top of a grassy hill suggests the last
oral remnant of some long-rotted giant in the earth.  Though some columns
are bent, and others lean against their companion stones, in the thirty-foot
diameter circle, only one stone has truly fallen over.  
 
A sign has been firmly planted in the ground here.
Some graffiti was carelessly scrawled on a stone.

A gap measuring five feet on a side remains where an ancient dolmen
recently fell.  The cavity is utterly dark, however, rounded steps are
visible within the gap, plunging into the earth at a steep angle.  Cobwebs,
thick with stone dust, smooth sharp corners, and the smell of earth,
moisture, and rot is strong in your nostrils.

Reliquary~
A rusted iron tripod is bolted to the floor in the center of a circular,
domed chamber.  The stone of the chamber appears worn, but the faint
suggestion of ancient runes and crude figures is visible.  Grasped in the
tripod's iron claw is an aquamarine sphere measuring about one foot in
diameter.  Vapor, like warm breath streaming in the cold air, rolls gently
off the sphere but dissipates before reaching the stone floor.

Chitine Warrior Barracks~
This large room is lit with a guttering, pale green light that flickers
from lamps in each corner.  The floor of the stone chamber is littered with
small bones, shreds of leather, and garbage, though a central ring of stones
remains clear, save for ashes of fires past.  Ten human sized web cocoons
hang down from the high ceiling, in no particualr arrangement, though none
hang over the fire pit.  A larger cocoon, measuring some ten feet in
diameter, hangs from the ceiling near the center of the west wall.

Sealed Studio~
Blocks of stone of all types and sizes squat in this chamber under a
patina of undisturbed dust.  Some of the blocks are completely square, but
many of them show evidence of a sculpter's chisel.  Rough heads, arms,
faces, and other forms are half-carved into many of the blocks.  On the
other hand, perhaps the forms are half-freed from imprisoning stone? 
Besides the unfinished sculptures, a stone work bench sits against the north
wall of the chamber.  Many stone-working implements are visible upon this
bench.

This six-sided chamber is tiled with alternating obsidian and red stone

of eight feet at the walls.  Directly below the point, a pitted globe hangs,
drizzling a wan, faded light.  An altar carved of black marble sits directly
across from the main entrance, and subtle runes are inscribed upon its
smooth surface.

You appear in a twenty-foot by twenty-foot square chamber of stone.  The
depth of the floor is difficult to determine because of the thick layer of
loose soil that covers it.  The ceiling here is low and hangs only seven
feet above the dark earth.  A darkened skull inscribed with runes sits in a
tiny alcove in the center of the west wall.
 
A silver door inscribed with the word STRIFE is to the east and
another silver door inscribed with the word WIT is to the west.

This chamber contains a single glass lamp set in the center of a low,
stone table.  The sickly olive light silhouettes several stone benches.  If
the grooves in the floor are any indication, the benches look as if they
have been dragged into this chamber from other areas.  A bundle of hide
parchment, a bone needle, and a small stoppered clay pot sit upon the table,
throwing long shadows on the wall.

You seek to escape from the House of Pain but you are not privy to the

answers, "six," and exits through a door.  A lady walks in and the
door-wight spits, "six," she answers "three," and walks out through a door. 
The door-wight turns to you and coughs, "ten."  Find the pattern and you
shall go free.  Fail and you die.  Choose the correct door to enter.

symbol of eternity tightly clutched in its teeth.

Dreaming~
Flashes of purple-green light emanate from a glowing skull-shaped stone
set in the wall of a domed chamber.  Never before seen creatures appear with
each flash and move to attack a magnificent white unicorn.  The beautiful
creature rears, but a strobe of light from the skull pierces its horn, and
the unicorn lets out a cry of despair before falling to the ground.
