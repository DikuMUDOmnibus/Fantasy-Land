A Path Between Mountains~
The path before you stretches down into a winding mountainous trail that
bends and weaves through gnarled vegetation, and around massive boulders and
rubble.  The air here is brisk and dry, and a gentle breeze tunnels up
through the cold white peaks.

A Cold Mountain Path~
The rubble strewn across the floor serves as tricky footing as the trail
winds and bends upwards through the {Dmountain{X.  Two massive trees grow on
either side of the path, jutting their roots into the hard stone below them.
The two tree's bend over the rubble-filled trail, joining together in a
large {gcanopy{x that sends dark shadows that dance in the cool breeze.

A Cold Mountain Path~
You come to the top of a steep incline in the trail and can see far down
to the valley below.  A vast forest stretches throughout the valley, and
comes to a stop near the shores of of what seems to be a small bay.  You
peer closer and can make out a small {wvillage{x hidden along the forest's edge,
and settled at the mouth of the misty bay.

A cool mountain breeze blows through here, playing a soft melody of moans

trail before you is barely discernible, and only a few tossed aside pebbles
and worn down blades of grass tell of any sign of travel through here.
