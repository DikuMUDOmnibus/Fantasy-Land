Reaching for the heart in behind the scales.                      Dragonslicer, Dragonslicer, where do you stay?                      In the belly of the giant that my blade impales.~

sword~
The blade of the sword is a full meter long and straight as an arrow, with
lightly-fluted sides.  Both edges are keened down to perfect lines, invisibly
sharp.  Perfection like this could have only been forged by a god.  The black
hilt is contrasted only by the faint symbol of a white arrow.
Upon the blade is engraved a poem:

                      Farslayer howls across the world
                      For thy heart, for thy heart, who hast wronged me!

Something about a revoked teaching credential due to toomany students dying or something. This does seem to be an odd place to havea scuba shop considering the sea is miles away. But I guess you couldalways go diving in the lake. But why?....There is a small sign here.~
