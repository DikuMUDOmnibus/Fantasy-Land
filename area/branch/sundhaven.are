citizens of the town of Sundhaven find it their pleasure to lounge
here. The dark marble temple rises like a shadow to the north, the
vivid colors of roses eastwards, and the library lies to the west.
There is a stone arch to the south.

inscription~
The inscription reads:
I met a traveller from an antique land,
Who said - "Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert... Near them, on the sand,
Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed.
And on the pedestal, these words appear:
I am the Fallen King, Kings of Kings,
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,
The lone and level sands stretch far away."

Homage and sacrifice to this human deity are paid here by the
other citizens of the realm.

atop a highland cliff, lined with mosses, lichen and purple heather,
and looking out over a foggy wetland. The graveyard for the dead of
Sundhaven lies near the foot of the cliffs, and in the far distance
you can make out the blue line of the sea closing the horizon.

In the shade of old gnarl-limbed elder trees stands the bane of all thieves
and murderers, the platform of the gallows. The dark sand of the road shows
none of the blood that has been shed here, but the legends of the dead live
on in tales and nightmares. The executions still take place at irregular
intervals, to the joy of hidden enemies and law-abiding citizens. You
note there is plenty of room for spectators.
Besides the east-west road, a stone arch stands to the north, and a
well-travelled path leads southwards.

A cluster of trees before the west gate~
You stand at a busy crossroads, darkened by the shade of an uneven
ring of oaks trellised with ivy. The wind brushes the leaves, but this
sound is dulled by the din of the town going about its daily business.
The ornate west gate lies just to the west, a road paved with black sand
runs east and north is a lane shaded by oak and ash trees.

A black sand road~
Black sand has been hauled up the steep cliffs from the beaches to
reduce the unpleasant affects of copious mud during the frequent
rains and heavy fogs of the region. The road is so heavily travelled
it has almost been packed down into a hard surface.

The butcher shop~
You are enclosed in a poorly lit, stuffy room that smells of blood,
salted meat and strange preservatives you didn't think existed in
this time period. Pewter cases filled with ice give off wisps of steam
near a roasting fire at the east wall. You might wonder why this place
is situated so proximate to the gallows, but the butcher nonchalantly
claims all his goods died peaceably, then turns away to stifle a chuckle.

The stables~
No whinnies issue from the darkened stalls of this place; the horses are
as yet untamed and the stables lie empty. It is not unusual for a vagrant
to make his home here, however, before being moved on by the guards or
attacked by the barn owls.

The west gate of Sundhaven~
An ornate gate, heavy and wrought from black iron, hangs on ancient hinges
to the west, bordered by slender elms. The ivy so plentiful in the town
is twined and braided about its intricate coils and carvings, which
consist largely of prowling cats and eclipsed circle designs.

The Dirk & Dagger~
A circular stone is whirring in a fast spin at the far wall,
as the weaponsmaster of Sundhaven continually sharpens his wares,
and re-hangs them to display on the stone and mortar walls.
A single window admits virtually no light, so filled with the
webs and dust of neglect is it.. obviously the shopowner prefers
to seclude himself to the obsessive labors of his work. You wonder
if he ever makes anything new, so fanatical he is about sharpening
and re-sharpening the old.

Your feet are hard put to find a purchase on the slippery floor
of spilled ale and cracked, sodden wood. This is the meeting
place of those of a fighting bent, accordingly the blood from
last night's brawls has barely dried on the walls before tonight's
is shed, be wary.

seems some sort of riot is underway in here - what would be a
strike if this wasn't before unions - among the numerous
disgruntled postal workers conglomerated. Shining silver letter-
openers flash in the light as they heedlessly try to backstab
anyone in sight. It's a droll scene. You decide it prudent to

of saints and martyrs, whether they died for the cause of good, or for

Artifacts and relics from a time before the known world are encased
and illumined in airless, black glass cabinets, their twinkling golden
and silver chasings catching your eye with mocking immortality. Urns
of demon ash line polished amberwood shelves, and a small, simple altar
edged in ivory stands against the north wall.
This is the sanctum of the ministry. Those of a pious bent would do

of suspicion on the back of your neck. The tenuous climbing vines
are dark green with black undersides, rather resembling.. poison
ivy.

A dark home filled with hanging moss~
You brush aside a curtain of dark green subterranean mosses and slip
inside a roomy cave of pitch darkness. The place has an eerie feel,
as if inhabited by some ethereal spirit that forbids you to abide
within. Cool moss of deep azure and green hangs in flowing tresses
from the ceiling, reminiscent of a prehistoric time.

A short rockslide~
You stand amidst a tumble of rocks of various sizes and shades of grey
and ebony. A pale hawk circles overhead, uttering a shivering cry.
It is impossible to continue downwards without meeting an untimely (?)
death. A few homes have been hidden here in the cliff face, a bit of
a hike from any civilization.

With the exception of the inexplicable darkness permeating this grove,
there is little way to explain the odd feeling of foreboding about this

barely enough to break the silence. Yet an odd presence makes itself

her waist stands beside a man with the robe of the priesthood.
The cold wind of the sea blows the sails of the rocking ship they
ride upon. The rogue woman is imploring a second man to destroy
a beast far too great for his strength, a cruel smile playing
upon her lips. 
The image is frozen upon the bark, immobile, yet it is apparent
she is winning the battle. Beneath the picture are engraved the

This is the gift of the previous Archmage upon his own guild.
He went on to fashion further portals all leading all over the 
known world, before the Lady Assassin extinguished his life.
Beyond the blue glare is a vision of the temple courtyard, the center
of town.

Some battered stone steps~
Broad, shallow stairs of dark stone descend into a hallway warm
with the heat of sparring warriors. Above you the sounds of the
alehouse distract you with bawdy laughter. A doorway is west,
bruised with sword-points.

The town treasury~
With the exception of a few portraits of the founders of you-don't-
know-what, the room is quite drab, and could benefit from some fresh
air. A huge pile of the town's wealth lies on the tile floor, guarded
from your meddling by a protective amber shield.

pile~
You can't get near it. On attempting to reach in and partake of
the wealth, a protective amber shield balks your hand as if it
were a wall of steel. 
However, you can create your own account by depositing some money.
If you want to know your balance, typing balance will do the job.
If you'd care to see it again, type withdraw (amount).
Then please put it back again. Your support is appreciated,
we know the town's security rests with you. Have a nice day.

The Tiger's Eye~
Three cases, locked and faced in glass, reveal their glittering
contents along the walls. These selfsame jewels perhaps attracted
you from the street... clouded pearls, white and blue diamonds,
amethyst and golden tigers eyes. Using 'list' will allow you to
peruse the goods available.

A stone path~
You stand just outside the eastern gate of the town of Sundhaven.
Fresh bread and cool drink await those within who are willing to
pay for the service, and about the city, other willing merchants
may also be found in abundance.
Eastwards the land stretches in unmarred wilderness to the far
horizon, and to the southeast you think you can catch glimpses of
the thatched roofs of yet another village, this one smaller and more
humble.
A trail south along the cobblestone wall seems to head in that
direction.

Along the town wall~
You follow the thick wall of grey cobblestone that marks the
outer border of Sundhaven. Moss, nourished by frequent rainfall,
hides portions of the wall under its green tendrils. A stony
path can be made out to the north, and the wall makes its way
southwards to a corner.

Along the town wall~
You reach a bend in the town wall, and the trail follows it on
both sides to the north and west. Ivy growing along the wall here
brushes your arm as you pass. Dense shrubbery lining the path to
the east renders that way unnavigable.

Along the town wall~
A small path lined with broad trees breaks off to the south from
the cobblestone wall of Sundhaven, which runs eastwards to a corner.
The gate of the town must be somewhere near. You can make out the
buzz of city life, hushed by the stone barrier, from the north.

A path hung with moss~
A narrow path bordered with ancient, broad-trunked trees leads
north to the town wall of Sundhaven and southwards to a short drop.
Moss completely covers and overflows from the oaks, brushing the
hair and helms of all but the shortest races of beings.

A short mossy cliff~
A four foot grey stone cliff, matted with clumps of green moss
and overhung with tall bending trees, is easily scaled by handy
footholds in the rock. The place looks well-travelled by some
hardy population of small-footed creatures.
One path continues in a north-south vein over the cliff, another
breaks off and leads east.

A path hung with moss~
The slender trail winds its way north-south through bending
trees laiden with spanish moss. (Except this was before Spain.)
It comes to an end before the bubbling ebbs of a tiny stream,
pouring gently forth from a hole in the rock on which you are
poised, and flows southward. A large road is just visible through
the trees to the south.

A stream~
A quietly flowing stream drifts down a slim riverbed, leading south
from a small hole in the rock to the north. The water is clear and
pure, and seems entirely empty of creatures.. It may be true
this stream was taxed by heavy fishing long ago that long since
cleaned it of all life.

A stream~
The clear waters begin to shift and curl and the current increase
slightly. Tiny brown reeds on the banks lean downstream, sending the
dragonflies airborne from their stalks. A wind whistles in the leaves
of the trees above and no sound can be made out from ahead.

A whirlpool~
A slowly churning blue whirlpool pulls you gently underwater, without
sound and without breath. The tree-darkened sky disappears in a
circular motion above your eyes as the world turns to water, and you
cannot help but feel that what goes down, must continue down..

The waters engulf you and suck you downwards, where you awake with
stars circling before your eyes.

A stairwell~
An old temple stairwell winds down in darkness into the inner, long
abandoned recesses of the golden temple. It seems few have reason
to travel this way. The dust that coats the steps lies mostly
undisturbed, and an aura of desertion hangs about the place.
Whoever does traverse these ancient halls may or may not have
the light of goodness in their motivations.

A seatless landing creates a pause in the stairwell before its final

place may have once been hung with numerous paintings or tapestries,
possibly comemorating the priests and gods of the past.

A dark corridor~
Shadows seem to creep within the shadows already existing, clashing
and clambering over one another before the approach of your footfalls,
yet everything seems to indicate to you that this is not the sort of
fun fairy-tale niche your mother liked to tell tales about by the
fireside of your ancient home. Do you continue, or turn back? Sometimes
shadows may form a bluff of great danger in the recesses of your
imagination.

The corridor halts abruptly. A drop opens out at your feet, beneath
which water shivers and shimmers, black against black. The pool is 
nearly still, only an occasional ripple moving across the surface
gives any indication of life, or life in death, within.
Northwards the hall disappears into the dark.

Edge of a black-bottom pool~
You wade ankle-deep into the murky waters of a black-bottom pool.
It appears this pool was once a nice pleasure bath for the priests
and their guests, but has fallen into decay from recent lack of
use. Who knows what creatures make their home beneath the dark
surface.

Swamp-like waters black as coal enclose you and wash like cold

underwater creatures that now make this their home.
