The Room of Healing~
You have entered the healing chambers.  This is where the temple healer,
cures and sick and lame.  The smell of herbs and spices fills your nose as
you walk in, and almost makes your eyes water.  The oaken shelves are filled
with potions, scrolls, and staves of curation.  The healer sits beside a
sick bed, with a man on it.  She grinds some herbs in a small bowl and then
feeds thme to him.  The only exit is west, back to the temple hall.

The Room of Giving~
This is the room where people can donate things for people less fortunate
than themselves.  The smooth gray marble walls are bare except for an old
proverb about giving and receiving.  Theres a large white marble box, filled
with all sorts of things that were donated.  Priests and other adventurers
come in every once in awhile and put something in it, then it gets emptied
and given to the poor.  The only exit is east, back to the temple hall.

Driscoll's Alchemy Shop~
You have entered a small shop.  There is a strong smell of chemicals, and
powder floats through the air freely.  It looks like another explosion has
wreaked havok upon this alchemy shop.  A few fires are being put out by the
gnomish shopkeeper, as he curses in his own language.  Beakers and bottles
of chemicals are laying on the floor and sitting on the few shelves that
remain intact.  The only exit is south, back to Vendrini Avenue.

Vendrini Avenue~
You are walking down a rougher part of town, which Vendrini avenue goes
through.  The road is pretty much broken up here, and very few people pass
you.  There is a stink of urine in the air, and you think you can hear
screams.  Sometimes you'll see a thief or two run down the street after a
successful robbery.  Some hired thugs in weird leather outfits also grace
this area of the street.  This is all probably because Shadow Street is to
the north.  Vendrini Street continues east and west, while south is some
kind of Alley.

walk down it freely, because the cityguards are way too afraid to patrol
here.  A few run down old shops and scattered here and there along the edge
of the road, but they don't at all look very inviting.  Rats and other
vermin scurry down the street, and in some of the alleys you think you can
see red eyes watching you.  Shadow street continues north and south is
Vendrini Avenue.  You think you can see two buildings west and east.

your feet.  Theres an odd smell of rat feces and blood here, but you can't
see anything that would explain the blood smell.  There are no back exits in
the buildings that this alley runs between, so there would be no help if you
were attacked.  The only known exit is north, back to Vendrini Avenue.

Outside The South Gates of T'cchalla~
You are standing outside the south gates of the city of T'cchalla.  The
black marble gates rise up before you as you approach, showing their utter
magnificence and beauty.  A few tourists stand with their mouths open at the
sight of them.  Some magical runes are scrawled on their pitch black
surface, used to ward off attacks from goblin raiders.  North is inside the
gates.

Shadow Street~
You are walking down shadow street, the poorest, most run down steet in
all of T'cchalla.  The road is so narrow, that the buildings block out most
of the light, hence the name.  Dirt and grime are piled along the sides of
the road, and theres a constant smell of urine and decay.  Most of the
buildings here look decayed, and have alot of their windows busted up. 
Shadow street continues north and south.

Dead End~
You have reached a dead end.  This part of the street is so narrow, that
its almost as dark as the famed goblin mines.  Dirt and grime can be seen
everywhere.  On the buildings, on the street, and even on some people
walking by.  Thugs and other thieves push past you, trying to go do some
dirty deed.  Shadow street continues south.

The Guild of Thieves~
You have entered the famous guild of thieves.  The cityguard and members
of certain law clans have been trying to find this place for years.  Theres
a few torchs on the walls that light up this otherwise dark and gloomy
warehouse.  Some grime and filth can be seen on the ground.  Thieves watch
you from out of the corner of their eyes.  Many a person that has found this
place has ended up with a dagger in their back, and all their money stolen. 
South is back to Shadow street and east is further inside the thieves guild.

The Thieve's Warehouse~
You have gone deeper into the thieves guild warehouse.  There are no
windows, so there is very little light.  What small ammount of light there
is, is provided by a few torchs placed around the walls.  You can make out
swiftly moving men and woman, walking through the shadows almost unseen. 
You better be careful or you could end up in the sea with a dagger in your
back.  West is the entrance.  North is the training room and south is the
bar.

The Training Room~
You have entered the training room of the thieves guild.  There is better
lighting in here than in the rest of the guild, but it is still too dark to
see the faces of anyone in here.  You can barely make out practice dummys,
lined with bells.  The bells ring everytime something is taken from one of
the dummys pockets.  Only master thieves can actually take something from
thme, so they are used as a training exercise.  The only exit is south, back
to them ain hall.

The Thieve's Bar~
You are standing in the thieve's guild bar room.  A few torchs are
mounted on the walls to light this otherwise dark warehouse.  Ratty looking
bar stools are placed beside a equally ratty looking counter.  As you watch
some of the thieves drinking, you realize they aren't really drinking at
all.  They are pretending to be drunk so the others will let their guard
down, and they can steal from them.  The only exit is north, back to the
main part of the guild.

Vendrini Avenue~
You are walking down Vendrini avenue.  The road gets wider here, and the
crowd gets bigger.  As you get closer to the docks, the smell of the sea and
the salty sting in your eyes get worse and worse, or better and better,
depending on your point of view.  To the north you can see a large building
with the universal symbol for Aabbanon money on it.  Vendrini Avenue
continues west and east.

Vendrini Avenue~
You are walking down Vendrini Avenue.  The road starts to narrow again
here, and the crowds start to thin.  You also see more rough looking types
walking with you than before.  Less buildings can be seen along the road,
until there are none at all.  You can see a few drunken sailors staggering
around, and one is lying in his own vomit.  Vendrini avenue continues west,
and east is the docks.

The Docks~
You have reached the docks.  The shrieks of the gulls and the sound of
waves as they lap up against the dock creates a soothing atmosphere.  At
least it would be soothing if some gruff sailors weren't trash talking while
they get their boat ready.  The docks are strong and sturdy, they were
probably made by dwarves, so that adds to their strength.  The docks
continue south and west is Vendrini Avenue.

The Docks~
You are walking down the Docks of T'cchalla.  The salty sea air lifts up
as spirits, almost as much as it stings your eyes.  The docks creak under
you as you walk, and you can hear the sound of gulls shrieking in the
distance.  The docks also seem to be lower here, so many an icy wave leaps
up and hits you in the face.  The docks continues south and north.

The Docks~
You are standing in the middle part of the docks of T'cchalla.  The
shrieks of the gulls, the lapping of the waves against the docks, and the
sound of people walking down the docks, create an oceanic symphony.  You can
see the craftsmenship that took to make these docks though, since they are
so strong and sturdy.  A few ships are tied to them and some canoes too. 
The docks continues north and south.  West is an Inn.

The Docks~
You are walking down the docks of T'cchalla.  Its very relaxing to just
stand here and listen to the shrieks of the gulls and the lapping of the
waves against the wooden docks.  The smell of the sea and the sting of the
salty air makes you feel at peace with the world and yourself.  You can see
a huge ship to the east though.  Its flying a large black flag, which has a
skull and cross bones emblem on it.  The docks continue north and south.

Inn Hall~
You have climbed the staircase and are now standing in the inn hallway. 
Theres and end tables placed against the east and west walls, with a candle
on each of them.  That creates a dim but ok ammount of lighting.  Some maids
scurry between rooms, fixing thme up for the next customers, and putting
mints on each of the bed's pillows.  Down leads to the common room, while
east, west, north and south all lead to Inn rooms.
