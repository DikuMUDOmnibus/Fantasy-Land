A Path to a City~
A wide dirt path heads towards some sort of city.  All around the path,
undergrowth springs up and animals dart to and fro, across the path and
around it.  The trees are quite thick on either side but they appear to thin
out towards the east as the land becomes more flat.  A fresh breeze stirs
the air and with it come the sounds of citylife.  There is a SIGN posted
beside the road here.

{$Outside the Gates of Tolchalla{x~
These are the western gates of the port city known as Tolchalla.  You can
smell the briny sea air, drifting over the city from the sea on the eastern
side.  The large black marble gates loom over you and have been carved with
several large arcane symbols, possibly to protect the city from raiders. 
The path leads away from the city to the west and into the city itself to
the east.

{$Inside the West Gates of Tolchalla{x~
You are standing inside the west gates of Tolchalla.  AS you look east,
you see the splendor of the city stretch out before you.  Merchants and
sailors are the main population of the city, so you see a whole lot of big
burly men, and prissy looking ones in fine clothes.  Being fairly new,
Tolchalla is very bright and gaudy looking.  Signs to different bars, and
shops are all painted in bright colors to attract the eye.  West is outside
the gates and east is Sword Street.

You are walking down a street in the city of Tolchalla.  This is

bright, and sometimes ostentatious colors.  Merchants in fine clothes and
golden rings, sniff at you as you walk by, and large burly men, obviously
sailors, push past you in a most unfriendly manner.  West is near the gates,
and Sword Street continues east.  North and south are shops.

room.  It has all kinds of maps and pictures of land marks in the city.  A
small man, who you wouldn't want to be alone with in a dark alley, is
standing behind it.  The only exit is south, to Sword Street.

hang from hangers in the back.  The only exit is North back to Sword Street.

flutes and guitars.  A bar is almost hidden away in the corner of the room,
but serving the only drink which seems to be needed here, beer.  A stage
stands at the opposite end of the room where the girls dance, removing their
clothing as they gyrate.  Sailors and merchants are obviously having a good
time as their eyes don't leave the girls.  The exit is to the south, to

spell books and staves and reach from floor to ceiling and against every
single wall save that of the exit.  A cat with two heads and green fur sits
on the counter and watches you suspiciously.  An old man potters around the
back of the counter as if searching for something he lost years ago.  Sword

quite a busy place as it leads to the main areas in the town.  A cityguard
stands right at the centre keeping an eye on people.  Carriage drivers yell
at each other to move out of the way, adding to the stress and bustle of the
location.  Sword Street continues east and west whilst Dragon Street runs
north to south.

You have entered a really small building.  In fact, its so small, you
almost bump your head on the ceiling.  Small yet stocky and strong people
move around this pub.  They are all wearing chainmail and have long beards,
its also almost impossible to tell the males from the females.  The benches
are really small, so you find your legs having to scrunch up as you sit
down.  The only exit is west, back to Dragon Street.

The Silver Seas Tavern~
This is a fair sized tavern.  The ceiling is low and draped in fishing
nets and riggings from ships.  The walls are covered in paintings of fishing
boats and schooners.  People, mostly sailors, sit around at the bar drowning
their sorrows.  The owner of the tavern, also the bartender, keeps a wary
eye on the sailors and other customers, keeping them plied with ale whilst
filling his pockets with cash.  Dragon Street lies to the east, through the
only exit.

Market Square~
You are standing on the market square.  Many people walk around, all
looking for the perfect piece of merchandise for whatever problem they have.
Shop carts are set up, mostly kind of ratty looking, but still good.  People
of all different races stand in one corner or the other, chatting about
life, love, and politics.  Benches and park tables, stand in the middle of
the square, for people to sit on and admire their new items.  Dragon Street
continues north and south, while east and west veers off into Vendrini
Avenue.

City guards walk down the street in their well polished armor, and they look
for thieves.  West is the market square, and Vendrini Avenue continues east.

one end and pure black oynx on the other, as if to represent the balance of
good and evil.  The walls are made of gray marble, since the temple is
neutral and intent of maintaining the balance.  A few temple guardians glare
at you as you enter, trying to make sure you won't defile the temple.  North

screams.  Sometimes you'll see a thief or two run down the street after a
successful robbery.  Some hired thugs in weird leather outfits also grace
this area of the street.  This is all probably because Shadow Street is to
the north.  Vendrini Street continues east and west, while south is some
kind of Alley.

apparently useless clutter.  But you might as well take a look, you never
know what you might pick up.

Carey's Fish Market~
You have entered a small, yet well taken care of shop.  A foul stench
fills your nose as you enter, and it almost makes you gag.  The walls are
painted puke green and the floor has some fish guts on it.  Fish heads and
bloody cleavers sit on a chopping block behind the counter.  The fish that
people can buy sits under glass behind the counter, so people can see what
they might want to buy.  The only exit is east.

{$Inside The North Gates of Tolchalla{x~
You are standing inside the north gates of Tolchalla.  They rise up
before you, in all their glory.  They are made of pure black marble, and
carved with arcane symbols which supposedly protect the city from evil.  You
can smell the salty sea air as you get farther away from the gates. 
Tolchalla is a prominent port town, a place where merchants and sailors are
the main population.  You can see Dragon Street to the south, and north is
outside the north gates.

You have entered a small bakery.  The smell of baking cakes and cookies
fills your nose and almost can't help but bring a smile to your face.  Your
mouth waters as you see all the pastries, cookies, rolls and breads of all
different kinds sealed up under glass display cases.  The walls are painted
a cheery apple color, probably to make the customer in a mood to buy.  The

Shop and to the south, the Mage's guild.  Sword Street continues east and

Jogan's Pawn Shop~
You have entered a small pawn shop.  This is where the poor people of the
city pawn off their possessions for money in order to pay off debts and
such.  The walls are painted a tacky neon pink, and the carpet is an even
tackier plaid.  All kinds of trinkets and items are laid out on shelves,
each with signs saying what they are by them.  The owner, a sleazy looking
fat man, asks you what you want to buy or sell.  The only exit is south,

The Mage's Institute of Higher Learning~
You are standing before the mage's tower.  It rises up before you, bathed
in swirling shadows and holy light.  It is made of pure black granite and pure
white marble.  Every once in awhile a large ball of lightning will come from
the heavens and strike somebody walking by the tower.  This particular
building isn't exactly the safest place to work or even be near.  South is

You are walking down Sword Street.  Bright colored signs and banners,
proclaim big name restaurants, bars, and shops.  Large crowds of people walk
neck and neck, trying to get to different places, almost in a sort of race. 
Sometimes a carriage or a cityguard will ride by, making everyone grudgingly
move out of the way.  You are close to the docks, so the smell of the sea,
really starts to feel your nostrils and your eyes are starting to feel the
salty sting.  East is the docks and Sword Street runs west.  North and south
are shops.

The Docks~
You are walking down the Docks of Tolchalla.  The smell of the sea and
the sting of the salty sea air lifts your spirit up.  The docks are made of
wooden baords, glued together with tar and sealed with some wood paint, so
they don't get destroyed by the salty sea.  If you look over the side of the
docks, you can see the icy waters of the sea.  The waves lap over up to the
side of the docks, but rarely get large enough to hit you.  West is Sword
Street and the docks continue north.

see, there is a forge behind the shop counter, where a small dwarf is
banging away at a piece of metal, forging it into a weapon.  Finished
weapons brightly shine, as they hang from metal hooks, allowing you to see
the dwarf's craftsmanship.  The rest of the shop is pretty ordinary.  The

even though the rest of the city is having a sunny day.  There are some
carving on the black oynx walls, which are usually of weird angelic or
demonic faces.  Up continues your hellish trek, and north is back to the

your whole body.  You can see down, through the railing, to the city of
Tolchalla.  You must be up at least one thousand feet, so you better be
careful not to fall.  Two turrets are east and west.  They house the guild's
facilities and bars.  Down is back to the stairs.
