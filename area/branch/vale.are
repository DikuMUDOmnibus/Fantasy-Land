This man is the only sane and serious resident of Jester's Court.  
Perhaps this is why he is considered the REAL jester to the citizens

you are sane, then perhaps it is YOU that is crazy while everyone else is 
sane!  You shiver.

book~
This book tells the tale of this ancient Chinese ghost story.  It is a 
sad and tragic one.
	An honest but poor tax collector comes into town on a rainy 
day.  He tries to collect tribute from the merchants who owed tax money 
to the Emporer, but, his records having been blurred from the wet rain, 
is turned away.  Having no place to stay, he leaves town, and falls upon a 
ruined old temple, known as Lan Ro Temple, also known as Orchid Temple.  
There, he meets an old man, known as Commissioner Yen, who was fighting 
another man, a wandering warrior wishing to test his skill against Yen.  
After trying to settle the fight, the tax collector, Ning, seeks shelter 
inside the structure.  Hearing a haunting voice accompanied by a 
melodious lute, he wanders out to the pavillon by the lake and meets a 
beautiful young woman, who attempts to seduce him.  Unbeknownst to him, 
the woman is actually a ghost who works with other attractive ghosts to 
lure men to an evil demon.
	Seeing how innocent Ning was, the woman, Tsing, takes pity upon 
him and does not lead him to his death.  Instead, she begins to become 
attracted to him.  They eventually fall in love, but their love is 
doomed, because the demon had betrothed Tsing to Lord Black, another 
demon who resides in the spirit world.  
	Tsing's sister ghost eventually finds Ning and tries to devour 
him, but Tsing intervenes and saves Ning.  Commissioner Yen, seeing the 
evil ghosts, attacks the sister and destroys her.  Frightened by this 
apparant murder, Ning runs to court to report Yen.  Thus, he finds out 
that Yen is an important political figure.  Yen then tells Ning that 
Tsing is a ghost.  Ning does not believe him, and Yen is forced to take 
Ning to the girl's "house", which in daylight, is nothing more than a 
graveyard.  Here Ning finds Tsing's name on a gravestone.
	Tsing comes back to Ning later that night and he pushes her away, 
frightened.  He confronts her and asks her if she is a ghost, and she 
nods and reveals that she is indeed a ghost to him.  Ning becomes more 
scared and hurts her with chants and the Diamond sutra, given to him by 
Yen.  Saddened, Tsing replies by asking him if she had ever hurt him.  
She explains to him that ghosts, like men, retain the capacity to love or 
hurt, to be good or evil.  Ning relents, since he is in love with her.  
She tells him how she is forced to serve the demon since she was murdered 
and buried under a great tree that erved as a tree demon's home.  Ning 
vows to find her ashes and give them a decent burial, thus freeing her 
from the demon's spell and enabling her to reincarnate.  He manages to 
find her ashes and intends to give them a decent burial with Yen's help, 
but then Tsing is caught by the demon and drawn into the spirit world for 
her wedding to Lord Black.
	Yen and Tsing travel to the spirit world to retrieve her and 
battle Lord Black.  Ning manages to destroy Lord Black with the diamond 
sutra and they return to the mortal world at sunrise.  With sunlight fast 
approaching, Tsing has no choice but to return into her urn or be forever 
destroyed by the sunlight.  With a tearful goodbye, she returns to her 
ashes.  Ning, having finally found love, and now forced to lose it, keeps 
his promise and gives her a decent burial, wishing her all the happiness 
she deserves, yet saddened by the loss.

The Lost Vale~
You are in the Lost Vale.  This vale is heavily wooded with strange, dark
trees that seem to rustle and whisper to each other.  An eerie purplish blue
mist floats about the ground, obscuring any traces of tracks and clues to
whatever walked here before you.  The gnarled branches of the trees and
twisted trunks of the boles give you an unnatural feeling of paranoia. 
Maybe you should get out of the area while you still can.

Fool's Row~
You are on Fool's Row, the main road in the city of Jester's 
Court.  The road travels east and west, and a few shops can be found to 
the north and south sides of the road.  
	This city seems rather insane.  There are jesters and fools 
lounging about, juggling balls and knifes, and pulling tricks on each 
other.  You wonder if you are the only sane person in this whole entire city.

Inside Lan Ro Temple~
You are inside the once great Lan Ro Orchid Temple.  This once 
grand structure used to house monks and once was alive and bright with 
the joy of life.  Now it is cold and drab, and perhaps full of ghosts an 
ghouls.  The damp walls and floors give the place a moldy smell and you 
shiver as you hear something skitter off into the darkness as you approach.

You are in a giant hall.  Large marble columns support this part of the

You wonder if this truly hell..  Or heaven.

Stile's Bedroom~
You are in the Blue Adept's bedroom.  There is a small bed here 
decked out in blue sheets, a closet, a footchest, and a few drawers.  
There is nothing much of interest here, since Stile is usually naked in 
the serf world of Proton in which he spends half his time.

Floating in a Blue Light~
You didn't REALLY think that this castle would be without its 
defenses against intruders did you?  A wall slides shut behind you as you 
are trapped in a magical stasis field.
