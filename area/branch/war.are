Entrance To The War Zone~
Sounds of distant battle fill the air.  A monumental passageway dominates
the room.  It is adorned with skulls of those brave souls that were foolish
enough to dare enter within.  Cries of anguish permeate throughout
announcing yet another victim.  This is your last chance for retreat.  Enter
now and fight for honor, glory, riches, and most importantly, your life!

War Victims Depository~
Moaning coming from the beds lining the walls of the collection center
saturates the room.  Blood streams the floor and the sweet smell of death
tickles your nose.  Your corpse is laying on the ground waiting for you to
comfort it.  You can catch your breath here and recover from your battle on
the outside.  This is a safe heaven for those hurt to reunite with their
earthly posessions, so there is a big sign on the wall stating {rNO LOOTING,{x
{rNO KILLING, NO SMOKING{x When you finish recouperating you can enter the
world of the mortal through the gateway hanging in mid-air.

The Battle Grounds.~
You are standing in the middle of a war torn battle zone.  As you survey
the land, you see battles off in the distance.  Magic fires blazing, swords
of steel clashing...  Blood gushes and splatters all about in a sea of red
horror.  A battle cry rings out behind you, and you whirl about to face the
coming onslaught.

A Bunker Under the Battle Grounds~
The ground in the corner of the Battle Zone has formed a snug bunker. 
From here, you can hear the sounds of the battles nearby, and the sunlight
barely reaches through the tiny opening you crawled through.  A strange box
stands covered by dust in the corner.

The Arena Floor~
The roar of the crowd echoes from above and around.  Beautifully raked
sand waits eagerly to accept the blood that will soon be spilt upon it. 
Only two ways out of the arena: victorous or dead.  The slime and stench of
the pit appears to be a short hop down from here, but there doesn't appear
to be a way back up.

The Pit~
The roar of the crowd echoes overhead.  Movement is slow in this morasses
of blood, mud, and the remains of previous combatants.  There is little
movement of the air here, and the smell is overpowering.

The Loser's Resting Spot~
You see blood splattered everywhere.  This place smells of death, sweat,
and other foul odors you cant distinguish.  As you think back to your
PITIFUL loss you see a rat scamper across the floor.  You <<*SMASH*>> the
poor defenseless creature because you have no other way to take out your
anger, and obviously you cant win against another person!
