Daffy Duck~
Daffy Duck splutters, "You're despicable!"

Porky Pig~
Porky Pig says "A-biya-biya-biya-That's All Folks!"
~
What a quaint little pig. So neatly dressed too. He seems to be quite well-
mannered and even tempered, but in this world anything could happen to make
him suddenly blow a fuse. Did you notice that he isn't wearing any pants?

Elmer Fudd~
Elmer Fudd says "Be vewy vewy quiet. I'm hunting wabbits!"
~
He certainly is, with his trusty shotgun. He is rugged up against the cold,
with his wool hat with ear warmers, his flannel jacket, and his hunting
boots. But you get the feeling that he won't have a very successful hunt.

Tweety Pie is a sweet little bird with an adoring owner. However his life
is constantly threatened by hungry cats such as Sylvester. Actually, that

real danger of being eaten.

Entrance to Looney Tunes Land~
You are heading along a small path lined with white stones toward a grassy
field. This field seems to extend in all directions as far as you can see.
It looks strangely two-dimensional. You hear the strains of "The Merry-Go-
Round broke down" playing somewhere...

There is a small sign here.

south. To the west a dark and thick forest starts abruptly.

This forest is rather forbidding, though some of its impact is lessened by
the fact that it feels as if you are walking past sheets of paper with
drawings of trees on them. No matter which way you walk, the trees converge
to one side of you, never in front, or behind, or around you. You can't seem
