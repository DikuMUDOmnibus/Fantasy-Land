Gathering Room~
The area before the chapel is a large open space, for guests to mingle
before going in.  Small tables of flowers sit in the four corners.  Here is
where guests wait for ushers to seat them and where the bride will collect
her thoughts before her final walk to the altar.  There is a small staircase
leading down on the eastern wall.

The glass case is full of beautiful flowers, lots of in-season ones, and
many that are out-of-season or hard to find.  Arlene is highly trained in
her craft, and knows how to cut a rose in hundreds of different ways.

Bride's Room~
Wow, this room is beautiful.  Tiny glass spheres hover about the room,
inside of each is a tiny lightbug, glowing brightly.  Mirrors and plants
make the room seem huge.  Small bundles of fresh herbs are hung where their
aromatherapy can calm the anxious bridal party.  A few comfortable chairs
sit around the room, and a few large hooks hang on the wall for the bridal
parties clothes.
