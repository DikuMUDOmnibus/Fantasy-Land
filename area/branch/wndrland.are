{0 {0 Welcome back good sirs to this world renowned line of books detailing the proper ways to 
{0 maintain your professional image.
{0 This book gives step-by-step instructions into the multi-faceted relm of 
{0 whiskers and fur.
{0 Before we begin lets look at the 4 basic principles.
{0 {0 - Whisker straightners and crocodile-toothed combs are your best companion.
{0 {0 - Practice makes perfect. Pretending there's a tea with the Queen is good motivation.  
{0 {0 - Write down your thoughts about grooming. (before bed-time is recommended)
{0 {0 - Lastly, instead of focusing on one particular area step back and take in the big picture.
{0 {0 Now of course these may seem obvious to you dear reader but one can never
{0 underestimate the power of positive reinforcement. 
{0 And remember, it only takes one grooming mishap to tarnish ones professional image.
{0 Now let us begin in ernest. The first chapter will focus entirely on the 
{0 image as seen in a mirror. As you all know, it can be very misleading! So 
{0 without further adeu, I present to you - the beginning. (Unless you are reading this book backwards in which case it would be the end.)

the Queen of Spades.  The present was never received as the Queen of Spade's
head now lies somewhere distinctly seperate from her body.  It is a crown of
blood, one of mystery, and of sadness.

Beau Gilley you are a nut.  Why drive yourself crazy when you can walk? 
Well thats why God made feet.  To walk with?  No to push the gas pedal. 
Thank you I'm hear all week.  Redemption, you kept me going when my soul felt
dry and cold.  This area is for you and all you were, are, and will be.  I'm
socially inept but that was ok most of the time curled up inside a ball of
text and love.  I could never carry on conversations with people in the same
room as myself.  I would feel distinctly uncomfortable.  Isn't that odd? 
This is getting long and the day is getting on.  SO why not pack my things
and head on down the road.  Where tommorrow will find me.  I'll never know
