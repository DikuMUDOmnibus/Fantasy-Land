Kitty Pryde~
A slender girl with brownish hair is resting here.
~
Kitty Pryde has been through many changes and stages of her life both in
and outside of the X-men.  Previously known as Sprite, she has assumed the
name ShadowCat as her alias.  Her soft amber eyes and matching hair frame a
gentle face that still retains the innocence of youth.  Her relaxed pose and
peaceful demeanor, however, hide the extensive combat training she has
learned from her experiences and personal training with Logan.

Iceman~
A man made of ice stands here, making ice cubes.
~
Bobby Drake, also known as Iceman, is a young man with the mutant powers
of changing himself into ice.  He has been with the X-men for a VERY long
time and is filled with the years of experience fighting side by side with
them in countless battles to save the world.  Iceman is able to generate
blasts of intense cold that freeze the moisture in the air into ice.  He can
manipulate this ice into virtually any form, from thick walls to delicate
sculptures.  At one time, Iceman was unable to control his power and wore an
inhibitor belt to contain them--but no longer.  Now this frosty mutant is
fully in command of his abilities and is always ready to chill any heated
situations!

Jubilee is here, listening to her radio.

When Jubilee's involved, the fireworks never stop!  This spunky
Chinese-American child of the Los Angeles malls is a blast in more ways than
one her mutant metabolism allows her to generate light-energy plasmoids that
explode with spectacular force.  Though Professor Xavier has since sidelined
her from active duty due to her very young age, Jubilee eagerly awaits the

Havok~
Havok is here, basking in the sunlight.
~
Alex Summers, also known as Havok, has been through many changes in his
life.  As the younger brother of X-Men leader Cyclops, he has always felt
that he was living in his brother's shadow, and tried much too hard to be
like him.  Once a proud member of the X-Men, Havok later joined and led the
government-sponsored group of mutants known as X-Factor.  With his awesome
power of releasing blasts of plasma energy, Havok is a foe to be reckoned
with.

The Beast~
Henry "Hank" McCoy is here, reading a thick textbook.
~
Within the brutish, animal-like exterior of the mutant known as the
Beast, dwells a brilliant scientific mind for while the Beast is
superhumanly strong and astoundingly agile, he is also one of the world's
foremost experts in biochemistry.  When not battling evil alongside the
X-Men, he devotes his time to expanding the frontiers of man's knowledge. 
He also possesses the largest vocabulary of any superhero, which he rarely
hestitates to use!  Covered by fuzzy blue hair, the Beast, once able to
switch between a regular human appearance and his beastly one, is now forced
to remain in his animal-like appearance.

The former X-Man known as Dazzler has the mutant ability to transmute
sound into incredible waves of light.  She can create intricate holographic
illusions, project powerful laser beams, or "dazzle" her opponents with
hypnotic bursts of color.  The X-Men first found her singing in a disco club
and helped protect her from the Sentinels which sought to kill all mutants. 
She eventually joined the X-Men and fell deeply in love with Longshot,
eventually following him to his dimension.

Forge~
Forge is here, making a better mousetrap.
~
From superpower neutralizers to defense-system disruptors, figuring how
to make it work is Forge's mutant power.  But his talents couldn't save him
from the scars of the Vietnam War, both physical--his right hand and leg had
to be replaced with cybernetics-- and psychological.  Now, as a member of
the X-Men, he fights another war, this time against the forces of hatred and
oppression that threaten to enslave mutant and human alike.  Forge has
fallen in love with Storm, but tremendous rifts have drawn them both
together as well as apart, and he will never be sure if he can win her heart
fully.

"Call me Domino."  Is the only answer she'll give, "because things just have

Phoenix~
Rachel Summers is watching the battle below.
~
As the daughter of an alternate reality's Jean Grey, Rachel claimed the
power of the Redemption.  As Redemption, Rachel's potential for destruction is
legendary, but her humanity keeps the Redemption force in check so that it can
be used for good.  Rachel traveled to our time from the future to alter
history, but found that this past was not her own.  Unable and unwilling to
return to her own time, Redemption allied herself with the X-Men and became one
of the founding members of Excalibur.

Cable~
Nathan Summers considers you an intruder and attacks!
~
Nathan Summers, the son of Scott Summers and the clone of Jean Grey named
Madelyne Pryor, grew up in an alternate future.  Not much is known about his
past.  His cunning and well-honed fighting skills, aided by his bionic
limbs, are all too familiar to his enemies.  In his short time as the leader
of X-Force, he has taken that team of young mutants and forged them into a
band of formidable soldiers.  In a world that hates and fears those with
mutant abilities, Cable believes only the toughest fighters will survive, an
attitude that mirrors that of his longtime foe, Apocalypse.  Cable also
possesses the mutant power of telekinesis, the ability to move objects with
his mind, as well as being a low-grade telepath.

Sabretooth is just one of the several man-made killers created by the
Weapon X project.  Once an ally of Wolverine, he is now one of the most
vicious of the X-Men's foes.  He has an incredible healing factor that makes
him immune to most drugs and poisons and he has a greater endurance than
most human beings.  With his fearsome claws, sharp teeth, and innate
savagery, Sabretooth has a bloodlust that is rivaled only by his hate for
Wolverine.

Entrance to the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning~
You are standing before a grand iron gate with a large X sigil set up the
top.  From here you can see the main mansion in the distance north.  Lush
fields of grass and trees are spread out before it, acting as a massive
front lawn.  The Xavier Institute for Higher Learning is a prestigious and
very selective place to gain schooling, and you wonder briefly what would
happen if they caught you in here.

before you to the north, leading to the main mansion.  The air here is calm
and cool, and the view from here is one of picturesque serenity.  You wonder
if you should apply for enrollment.

You have reached the front steps leading to the mansion of the Xavier
Institute.  This grand mansion seems to be composed mostly of solid marble
flanked with wood and looks to be rather sturdy and formal.  The roof rises
high above you, covering a number of floors in the mansion and a large
fountain can be heard gurgling to the north.

imposingly.  There is a set of brass door knockers bolted upon them and a
small doorbell button has been placed to the right of the doors.  A small

You are inside the main foyer of the Xavier Institure.  A large ornate
rug covers the smooth hardwood floor and the walls are filled with paintings
and plaques of the most famous of the Xavier Institute graduates.  A picture
of the alumni of the Institute hangs upon the west wall and a large crystal
chandelier is set high above you.  A number of windows lets the light in
from outside, bringing warmth to this otherwise bleak room.

This photograph captures the images of the most famous of the alumni of
the Xavier Institute.  A short stocky man with flowing sideburns stands in
front, drinking a beer.  Behind him in a row stands an attractive woman with
long red hair, an average man with strange red sunglasses upon his face, a
beautiful oriental woman with purple hair, a tall thin man with a brown
trenchcoat and ruby eyes, a huge muscular man with short black hair, any
many many more.

You are in the main hall of the Xavier Institute.  So far, you have seen
no evidence of classrooms of any kind and you wonder what types of classes
they actually teach here.  To the north you can see an intersection of some
kind and the way out of the mansion is to the south.

You are inside the room of Jubilation Lee.  This room is a total and

room.  Clothes are scattered everywhere and posters are tacked to every
square inch of the walls.  A huge Lila poster is hanging right above the
bed, which is unmade, blankets falling off to the side.  A closet to the
north houses identical pairs of yellow trenchcoats, red shirts, and blue
shorts.  You wonder if Jubilee has bad taste, or is just colorblind.

is much larger than any of the others, simply due to the size of space Forge

breeze blows past you as you stroll along, admiring the landscaping designs
done here.  Slender willow trees grow to either side of you and small pruned

smell of oil and gasoline is strong here and small puddles of antifreeze and
other liquids spot the floor.
