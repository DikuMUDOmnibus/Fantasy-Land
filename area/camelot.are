Entering Camelot ~
You enter the spacious courtyard of Camelot.  It is here that the
legendary King Arthur makes his residence and rules the surrounding land. 
With the aid of the honorable Knights of the Round Table to assist him, he
has made his people happy, prosperous, and safe from enemies.  The courtyard
is decorated with beautiful fountains and the walkway is made of the finest
stone.  An immaculately kept boxwood hedge forms the maze which lies to the
east.

carefully.  Over to one side, you can see a beautiful pond.  
Several ducklings are swimming there with their mother.  This 
land seems very peaceful and serene.  Throughout the area there

furiously.  As you ponder what type of creature they might be, 
a small bird sitting by the edge of the moat decides to get a 
drink.  Moments after it begins to drink, one fish lunges at 
the bird, grabs it, and drags the floundering animal into the 
moat.  There, the others hungrily devour it.

Royal Ante-Chamber~
Here is where King Arthur does all of his work.  A beautiful 
oak desk sits at the east end of the room overlooking the 
wondrous scenery of Camelot's Courtyard.  A giant mirror lies 
directly in front of you, reflecting the image of a worn 
adventurer.  The only exit appears to be at the south of the room.

Arthur's Private Chambers~
You've entered the private sleeping chamber of King Arthur.  
The room is littered with numerous artifacts given to him by 
those who fall under his rule.  Some, you surmise, did not give 
up these items easily.  However, your attention is soon drawn 
to the beautiful sword at Arthur's side.
