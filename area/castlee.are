This is Embla, left here by the gods to watch over the Hero's souls.
It might be a bad thing to let her find out you have slain some of
those souls....hmmm, a tactical retreat might be in order.

No mortal could match his sorcery or his kindness for that matter. He would
help anyone in need, good, evil, whatever it did not matter to him. Some
say that was his downfall, because his death was on the blade of tainted soul
whom was tricked into helping.

three Gods that created her. It would be a bad thing for her to find out you

Ymir's chambers~
Paintings line the walls in this room, there is a rather comfertable looking
bed in the center of the room, Ymir, prehaps the greatest Hero of Thera's time
is standing infront of you, wondering why you have disturbed him. He looks
nice enough, but don't let his exterior fool you, he could kill you with a
mear thought.
