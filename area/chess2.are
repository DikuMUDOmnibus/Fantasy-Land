The Black Square~
Obscure darkness overlays the room as you enter.  Perched along the four
corners of the room lies a small torch, each giving off some sense of relief
from absolute darkness.  The surface under your feet is made of a strange
black hardened marble as you also notice several blotches of blood recumbent
around you.  Distant battle-cries and shrieks of death can be heard from
around leaving you somewhat hesitated as you wield your weapon tightly and
become more aware of your surroundings.

Although the brightness of this room leaves you with some relief, it also
silences the noise into a shivering nothingness.  Decapitated body parts lie
about here along with plattering marks of blood along the white walls and
the hard white marbled floor.  Corridors into the other rooms lead into
total balckness as your heart beats rapidly wondering what you'd encounter
next.

The Black Square~
Obscure darkness overlays the room as you enter.  Perched along the four
corners of the room lies a small torch, each giving off some sense of relief
from absolute darkness.  The surface under your feet is made of a strange
black hardened marble as you also notice several blotches of blood recumbent
around you.  Distant battle-cries and shrieks of death can be heard from
around leaving you somewhat hesitated as you wield your weapon tightly and
become more aware of your surroundings.

The White Square~
Although the brightness of this room leaves you with some relief, it also
silences the noise into a shivering nothingness.  Decapitated body parts lie
about along here along with splattering marks of blood along the white walls
and the hard white marbled floor.  Corridors into the other rooms lead into
total blackness as your heart beats rapidly wondering what you'd encounter
next.

The White Square~
Although the brightness of this room leaves you with some relief, it also
silences the noise into a shivering nothingness.  Decapitated body parts
lies about here along with splattering marks of blood along the white walls
and the hard white marbled floor.  Corridors into the other rooms lead into
total blackness as your heart beats rapidly wondering what you'd encounter
next.

The Black Square~
Obscure darkness overlays the room as you enter.  Perched along the four
corners of the room lies a small torch, each giving off some sense of relief
from absolute darkness.  The surface under your feet is made of a strange
black hardened marble as you also notice several blotches of blood recumbent
around you.  Distant battle-cries and shrieks of death can be heard from
around leaving you somewhat hesitated as you wield your weapon tightly and
become more aware of your surroundings.

The Opening~
The once lush greeneries of the Haon Dor Forest has now widened & cleared
into the open to reveal a wide open space here in the green fields.  Many
wildlife can be seen all around you as a long path is visible to the west
and east.  A great castle is now more into view to the west.  Huge trees and
mountains from a distant Shadow Grove can be seen far beyond the castle in
the distance.  Small little insects scurry about the air here giving it
somewhat of a seasonal portrait of peace and serenity.  To the east is the
quiet forest.  To the west lies the castle.

A Long Path Through the Meadows ~
The path continues on east and west through this lovely and yet such
peaceful meadows outside the Haon Dor Forest which can be seen to the far
east of you.  To the south you familiarize the the southwestern path of the
Haon Dor Forest and darkness to the north and the northeast where the
unknown lies.  The castle to your west is fully in view and you scan to the
west to see a huge gate leading into the premises.

Before the Huge Castle~
You have now come upon a huge deserted castle which seems to be ancient
from the outer layered material of the premises.  Thick, cracked bricks are
shown all across the structure as you gaze to your left and right at this
sightly wonder.  The height of this castle stretches up about twenty feet
covered with a triangular roofing done on the corner ends of the building.
As you gaze to the east, the beauty of the meadows can be seen as far as it
goes back into the forest.  A huge GATE lies to your west blocking your
entrance into this castle.  A strange SIGN is posted by the GATE..  Maybe
you should read it.

Before the Gates of the Archonian Chessboard~
Before you lies a towering castle that leads inside it headed north.  Strange
screaming noises and wailings echo from the towers hanging high above as
many weird occurrences have been happening according to the commoners in
Midgaard.  To the south the flow of traffic in and out of Midgaard is
dense while inside to this castle seems more mysteriously quiet.
