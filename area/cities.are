Market Street is the busiest street in the whole town for not only does
it lead to the various shops in town, it also leads to the Temple of
Mattheus, the most fabled red dragon of them all.  Small boutiques and
larger shops litter the street, filling it with the smells of freshly baked
goods and the sounds of working.  Market Street continues to the south, and
the temple is a bit further to the north.
