You stand before a large bulking man.  He seems to have many scars
crisscrossing over his face, apparently earned in some tough battles.  Yet

You are looking at a beautiful woman.  She seems very young but something
in her eyes tells you she knows alot.  She appears at a first glance human,
but you notice the frail slim body and pointed ears usually marking as an
elf.  She has a very seductive figure and the way she walks makes her even
more attractive.  She flips her long golden locks of hair over her shoulder
and asks if she can help you with anything.

The Keeper of Souls~
A beautiful woman is standing here, radiating in a glow of power.
~
You stand in awe as you stare at this woman.  She is about six foot tall,
yet somehow her appearance makes her look taller.  Her pale skin seems to
reflect light then sends it back out in the form of a soft golden glow that
engulfs her like an aura.  She has long dark brown hair that comes down to
the center of her back and seems to be of the finest material known to any
mortal.  It flows down over her shoulders like a cascading waterfall.  She
slowly flips her hair over her shoulders and looks at you through deep green
eyes.  Her eyes seems to hold the knowledge of the worlds in them.  She is
the purest form of beauty you've ever encountered.

A mirrored warrior~
A tall warrior made of mirror emerges from the wall.
~
You are looking at a tall warrior.  It appears to be created out of the
mirrored material and is quite featureless.  It's reflecting face takes the
image of your as you look at it.  It seems to be controlled by a more
powerful force than itself but you can't be for sure what drives it onward.

a mirror tiger~
A large mirrored tiger is here, moving slyly through the room.

You are staring basically at a series of mirrors.  They are shaped into
that of a giant cat that looks like a tiger.  It seems to be magically held
together and animated to make it a real creature.  You have no clue as to
what it's diet or purpose might be, but nor do you feel like waiting and
finding out.

The Southern Walk of Wind~
The road is a large wide road that seems to be travelled quite
frequently.  It's made of what seems a million small bricks cut out of a
black stone and placed together with the greatest of care.  The walk
continues North, towards the center of the town and the huge spiralling
towers.  The walk also continues to the South, looking like it leads to the
outside.  Two small houses are to the East and West.  You notice they have
many small slits in the walls as if archer spots in case of a seige.

The City of Souls~
You find yourself standing on a large cobblestone roadway.  The road
seems to be made of a dark black rock that seems to have cut to perfection
and fit together to form a very well constructed roadway.  To the South, a
large gate stands, used as defense from the outside world.  It is connected
to an emmensely tall rock wall that seems to surround the entire city.  To
the North you can see a large tower rise up into the air.  You can see
numerous others also rising off in the distance behind it.

The winds here are great as they swirl through the room like a tornado. 
In the center of the Southern wall, you can see a twisting cyclone leading
into what seems the wall itself as if a strong magic was sucking it into the
wall.  Despite the cyclone's appearance of suction, there is no vacuum
effect, but rather a blowing of wind.  The exit in which you came seems to
have vanished as there is no apparent exit out of this room.
