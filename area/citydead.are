smile at you and continues her work.  As you watch her, a small
sparkle of green light flickers lightly in her eyes but quickly
disappears from sight.  The magic within her seems to be alive

lit by a large chandelier that hangs high above you in the ceiling.

appear more recent than others at the times of death.  There are gaps

of a broom, showing the room is maintained to some degree.  There

further into the water, you realize that you are not sinking or the
water is not getting deeper.  You appear to be walking on the surface
of it.  Something jumps out of the water around you.  There is an
exit to the West.

The Wall of Blades~
You are standing in an extremely narrow hallway.  As you look further
down the hallway, you can see sharp projectiles apparently extending
from the walls.  They resemble long shards of mirror, almost like
pointed daggers.  They seems to be sticking out from the walls in
random lengths making it hard to judge a safe passage by them.  The
Hallway goes South and North.

A Mirrored Hallway~
You are standing in a narrow hallway.  The floor is made of a thick
mirror and as you look down, all you can see is an image of you looking
back up at you.  The walls also appear to be made of the same mirrored
surface.  The walls are angled and shifted in spots, making many different
images of you seem to be everywhere.  The Hallway goes West and East.

The Easthern Intersection~
You find yourself standing at a small three way split.  The directions
they lead off to are hard to determine however because you are surrounded
by mirrored walls that seem to send images of you endlessly around you.
You think the exits are leading off to the North, South, and West but
you can't be for certain.

The Hall of Mirrored Heat~
You are standing in a small hallway.  It seems unbearbaly hot here,
yet there is no flame anywhere near you.  As you look around, you
notice the walls and floor are made of a material similar to that
of a mirror.  Underneath, as if in the mirror, you can see huge
flames leap around.  You are unsure whether the flames will scorch
you or not, but the heat is immense.  The hall continues South
and North.

The Hall of Mirrored Heat~
You find yourself standing in an immense heat.  It appears to be a
hallway made of glass and mirrors.  The heat messes up your vision
added to the fact that the mirrors send your image everywhere.  Behind
the mirrors you can see an intense blaze going but not on the outside.
The hallway goes West and South.

The Mirrored Walls of Flame~
You are standing in a small narrow hallway.  The walls are made of
a red mirrored material that seems to reflect your images everywhere.
Behind the mirrors you can see a wall of flames that seem to burn
brighter than you've ever seen fire burn.  The heat in this room seems
to be almost unbearable as beads of sweat seem to form from every
pore on your body.  You can see and exit leading East and West.

A narrow strip of floor that is mirrored.  The walls are also mirrored,
but are of a deep red color.  All around the thin strip of land, you

the ground.  Suddenly something stills out of the pools.

The Mirrored Landscape~
You stand inside a small forest of sorts.  You notice one thing,
the entirety of it is made of mirrors.  The walls and trees are
mirror as is the grass.  As you walk, you shatter the small blades
of mirrored grass, but they suddenly reappear behind you, reforming
to how they were before you disturved them.  You can see an exit
to the North and South.

The Southtern Bend~
You stand in a vasst room that seems to not fit in the surrounding
area.  It seems too huge of a place to fit in this tower yet it exists
through magical means.  It resembles a huge forest but is made up
of mirrored surfaces.  Everything seems to reflect your image across
the room, and in some places distorting it a bit.  You see an exit
to the North and West.

stepping out of a mirror.
