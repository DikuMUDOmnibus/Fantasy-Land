attacks.  You seem to be the prey.

Outside a large clock~
Within the base of the clock the loud tick-tock echoes like a faint
click.  A high tower with a large clock stands.  The path here
is cluttered tightly but breaks open before the structure to the
north.  A faint trail to the south takes you into the large forest.

The sound of the clock reverbrates about like the thrum of blood in the
temple, ever insistent, never missing a beat.  All about a thin layer of
dust covers the floor.  Light scratching here and there implies that
someone...  Or something, has been moving about.  The walls and floor appear
to be made of solid pine and give off a faint aroma that is not altogether
unpleasing.  The occational scritch can be heard between the clock's
everincesant tick-tock, tick-tock.  There is a small hole apparently leading
out of the clock here while the base of the clock continues off in all other
directions.  A giant pendulum seems to be to the north.

The slowly moving pendulum swings back and forth and a rythmic motion not
unlike the sea.  The air is warm in the clock as very little air is able to
circulate through here.  Adding the ever present dust that hangs in the air
and you get a not so pleasant atmosphere.  It is difficult to see in the
murky half light but as the motion brings you to the east and west things
can be heard moving about.  There appears to be a ledge overhead where the
pendulum meets the clock head while the base of the clock is straight down
below.

the semitransparent face of the clock allows a murky colored light to seep

However, squinting would not be such a good idea as the number 10 seems to
be changing into something that looks amazing like a spider.  An awful

You stand here apon the actual face of the clock.  It is fairly slippery
as it seems to be made of mother of pearl.  The surface, being a murky white
color, reflects the light greatly making it hard to see without squinting. 
However, squinting would not be such a good idea as the number 11 seems to
be changing into something that looks amazing like a spider.  An awful

You stand here within the inner workings of the clock itself.  Gears
tumble into each other in a precise manner which leads to the next gear and

avoid the sharp edges from cutting through armor.  All the movement can
dizzy the senses.  A soft clinking sound seems to be coming from the south.
