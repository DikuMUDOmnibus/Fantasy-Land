narz~
Narz~
Narz grins evilly at you.
~
Narz is half black dragon and half drow.  In fact she looks like a drow except
she is extremely tall for a drow and has a long dragon's tail that she keeps
hidden beneath her cloak.  She has more natural beauty (from a human's 
perspective, not a dragon's) than any other in Cloudy Mountain.  She is very
vain and very dangerous.

This area is based on the Intellivison game "Advanced Dungeons and Dragons" 
which is of course based on TSR's role playing game.  The name Cloudy Mountain,
the caves in Cloudy Mountain and the mobs in Cloudy Mountain are taken 
directly from the game and credit should be given to Matel Electronics and TSR.
The city/village is from Scourge, summer 1996.  Some mob ideas are from TSR's
Monstrous Manual, copyright 1993, TSR, Inc.

Before the City of Cloudy Mountain~
In this are many dragons and half-dragons.  Under normal circumstances,
dragons tend to live in solitary environments, but due to disappearing 
territories, many have gathered in this city.  Some have also have taken 
spouses from other races, creating new half-races.  Although legally these
half-dragons are to be treated equal, most of the high ranking officials and
officers are pure dragon.

The Queen's Bedroom~
This empty room belonged to the human Queen of Cloudy Mountain.  No one 
know for sure how the queen died, but it is generally thought to be foul play.
Although the marriage was widely celebrated publicly, many of the pure dragon
nobles were against the marriage.  It has been rumored that Drakknar committed
this ghastly act, but those who know him well do not believe this.

A Winding Cavern~
You are now in a cavern.  It is slightly wider here, and the ceiling is very
high.  You cringe at the thought of all the stalactites falling on top of you.
Your light reflects off of certain parts of the cave wall.

Scourge' Room~
You have entered Scourge's private room.  It is rather dark, those of 
good alignment may find it sinister and feel uncomfortable...those who walk
the path of evil are right at home.  There is a roaring fire in the fireplace,
yet the room feels chilly.  There are some plants in the window, but they 
appear to be dead.  Scourge is sitting in a black and red chair, he grins 
at you evilly.

You meet his cold stare, as a chill runs up and down your spine, he speaks.
Scourge says, 'I am not here right now, if you would like to leave a message,
please leave your name, number, and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.'
