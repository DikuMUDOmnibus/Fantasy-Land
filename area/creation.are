twisted, and the metal seems strangely blackened.  A smooth black wall
extends away on both sides.  The surrounding vegetation closes in against
the wall, making movement to either side along the wall impossible.  The
wall rises thirty feet into the sky, above all the trees near it making that
way of entry impossible.  It seems that the gateway is the only entrance. 
Beyond the wall, only the faint outline of a tall tower can be seen.  All
seems cloaked in shadows.  {x

stories high and is made of some dark smooth substance.  Narrow slits are
cut in the walls to serve as windows but none are lower than twenty feet
high and all are too narrow to serve as ways of entry.  The ground here is
packed earth and no vegetation grows within the wall.  Not even the smallest
blade of grass can be seen.  {x

{DThis is a rather small library for a tower of spellcasters. 
Bookshelves occupy all the available wallspace, and a large reading table is
in the center of the room.  The books all seem to be of fairly basic nature,
the titles appear to be in strange languages.  The exit back to the corridor
is east.  {x

{W-<{BGuardroom{W>-{x~
{DThis seems to be some sort of guardroom.  A stairway leads down, and
another exit is to the east.  This room has no furnishings at all.  The
walls, floor and ceiling are all bare.  The enchanted weapons that are
locked in an indestructible case, and the damaged walls hint that this room
is used mainly for fighting.  {x

{W-<{BMain Workshop{W>-{x~
{DThis huge room is surely too large to fit within the tower.  Tables,
benches, shelves and stands are all ladden with beakers, flasks, cages,
jars, bottles, rocks, bags, boxes, books, manuels, tomes and scrolls.  This
place is a mess.  Various jobs seem to be all in a state of semi-completion.
Vaguely humaniod shapes moulded out of various substances stand half done. 
Large barrels, that serve as garbage bins, lie turned over.  One must wonder
how anyone can safely navigate through this dangerous room.  {x

or wasn't needed for immediate use.  Although this room is jammed with gear,
one can notice a semblance of order, and that the room is unusually clean.

{DThis is yet another large room, containing a large circular stairway in
the center.  The decorations here are more costly and elaborate.  There is
rich red carpet on the floor, and it also goes up the steps, which use
beautiful mahogany bannisters for support.  Incredible tapestries play out
illusionary scenes of epic magical battles.  {x

Beautiful red carpet adorns the floor, while the walls are completely
covered by a large mirror.  This gives the illusion that this room has no

to the south.  {x

around the edge.  The entire countryside beyond the wall can be seen clearly
from here.  To the west is the city of Midgaard, and the city of New Thalos
can be seen far east.  A land that seems to be experiencing conflicting
elements can be seen south, while a great plain is visible to the northwest.
