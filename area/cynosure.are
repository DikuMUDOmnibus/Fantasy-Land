Helm is the epitome of guardians, the watcher, the guard, and has in
years past been greatly venerated by those who need to remain watchful for
evil at their doorsteps.  He is giant, with a set of platemail to match, his
faceplate concealing his features.

those who use magic or magical in their daily use.

Kelemvor, Just God of the Dead, judges you fairly.

Kelemvor is a product of the Time of Troubles, much the same as Mystra
and Cyric, when the Gods were thrown out of the heavens and given mortal
Avatars.  When Mystra and Kelemvor slew Myrkyl atop blackstaff tower, they
had thought that their quest for the Tablets of Fate was at an end. 
However, the thief Cyric killed Kelemvor with one dishonorable blow from
behind, and he was sent to the Realm of the Dead which was to be ruled by
Cyric.  Not liking the unjust manner of Cyric's rule, he and other tortured
souls led a revolt which drove Cyric from his home, and he vowed to rule
with justice and compassion.

Mask, the God of Thieves, creeps silently towards you.
~
Mask was the deity of intrigue as well as being the Patron of
Thieves, but his disastrous perusal of the Cyrinishad led to Cyric being
able to steal this aspect of his portfolio from him.  One school of
thought believed the god totally destroyed after reading the Cyrinishad
and having his Godsbane avatar form destroyed by Cyric, another held
that Mask was totally subsumed by Cyric, and a third school believed
that Mask, engaged in his own intrigues, faked his loyalty to Cyric, and
later his own death.  The truth is that Mask survived the enslaving
effects of the Cyrinishad and the destruction of a major Avatar form at
great cost, losing much of his godly powers in the process.

Tymora~
Tymora, Goddess of Good luck, rolls the dice....and wins again!
~
Tymora is fickle but playful and never vengeful or malicious.  She
likes a good joke and has been known to play on occasional joke on some
of the Realms more straight-laced deities, such as Helm or Tyr.  She is
reputed by Sages to have had short lived romances with several of the
good male deities, but these ended amicably on both sides after awhile.

the heavens themselves.  Looking up, the ray of bluish white light

Before the top of the Celestial Stairway~
Soaring ever closer to the heavens, you are now able to discern that you
following a Celestial Staircase, rumored to lead to the Palace of Cynosure,
meeting place of the Gods.  The Stairway itself is composed of an infinite
number of ghostly white hands, gently pulling you up into the clouds.

grey building formed of some stone you do not recognize.  More Importantly,
you can see Helm, The God of Guardians, standing a vigilant watch over
Cynosure.  There is still time to turn back, as it is his job to prevent
mortals from entering here.

Iron gates and huge stone walls.  There is a bridge leading into the keep,
guarded by a twelve man watch, each standing absolutely rigid and alert. 
They are dressed in full plate armor, and wear the symbol of the Unsleeping
Eyes on their shields.

The Blackkeep of the Godson~
This jet black keep is very large and constructed of a dark metal.  You
see a line of chained slaves hauling precious metals, building materials and
other sundries.  It looks as if happiness is not a viable concept in this
realm.

impliments hang on the walls, sharp and wicked, and some you can only
imagine the uses.  Fresh pools of blood drip slowly down a black leather
bench.  Remnants of skin and bone can be seen on a set of shackles nearby. 
Chains hang from the ceiling, silver and bright, and waiting for someone to
bind.
