Entrance to Dagger Falls~
This is the entrance to Dagger Falls, the legendary hide out of thieves
all over the world.  As you look around this narrow room, you notice that
the cave seem to open up further north; closely grown trees provided a thick
barrier between the entrance and the hideout itself.  The only thing that
seems to light up this room is the light that shines through the waterfalls
from the south.

A road to the true training grounds~
As you scan the area, you notice the road leads to the true training
ground of thieves. It's best if you don't go in there, you don't know what
they might do to you! Perhaps backstab you when your not looking and kill you
for whatever you have on you.

untrained eye, this might seem as chaos, but to a thief; it's a true training
ground, a challenge of wit and skills. Survival of the quickest.

Now THIS is a treasury room. Mounds and mounds of gold and
