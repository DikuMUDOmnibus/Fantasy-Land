The northeast corner of the great hall~
This corner of the hall seems darker and colder then the rest of the
hall. Warmer parts of the hall can be seen to the south and to the west.

A small room~
You have entered a small room behind the throne. It is plain and bare
and looks very stark after the golden great hall. There are three exits out of
the room. The first is west back to the hall. The second is through a small
door to the south, and the third is up through a hole in the ceiling.

The most significant thing you notice about the room is that it has
no floor. Exits are west through the gold door, or down through the hole.

The outer chamber~
This is Darathorn's outer chamber and study. Most of his vilianous
business is conducted from here. Only his most trusted men are allowed in
here. The chamber is very functional. No frills or decorations can be seen.
Darathorn likes to keep business and pleasure seperate. A large oak door is
to the north.

Darathorn's bedroom~
You are in Darathorn's bedroom. It is big and everything in it is big.
The bed looks as if it could comfortably hold 5 people. A large mirror on the
east wall and an over-stuffed armchair are the only other things in the
room.

NO more ladder~
AAAAHHHHH!!!!! where is that ladder. The ladder has been devoured by
the mist. Since the ladder is no longer there, there is nothing preventing
you from falling. And so you do fall... a long long way. You eventually hit
the bottom, bounce twice and that is that.

A dead end~
Work on the passage seems incomplete. Tools have been left abandoned
on the ground. From the looks of things, the workers left in a hurry. Or then
again maybe they didn't leave. You notice some objects that look very much
like human bones. The only exit is towards the west.

Tolorian's Laboritory~
Compared to the other rooms you have seen, this room is full. The
walls are completely obscured by book ladden shelves. The centre of the room
is filled with a large wooden desk, which in turn is covered in books and
scrolls of all types and description. The rest of the room is clutered by
piles of books and other strange items, the function and use of which,
completely elude you.

OOPS!!! As you move back through the hole you bump the unstable rocks
and the last thought on your mind, as thousands of tonnes of rock fall on top
of you, is: "Boy, was that a STUPID thing to do".
