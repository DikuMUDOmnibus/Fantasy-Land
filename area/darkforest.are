{8Huge trees tower over the forest bed, allowing only shreds of light to reach
the ground.  The trees sway ever so slightly with the breeze, the branches like
long arms swaying hypnotically back and forth.  It is rumoured all the villains
fled to the forest to escape persecution since no sane being would dare give
chase in the dark forest.  It is also rumoured that there are hidden treasures
within.  This remains to be seen.  Beware the forest is vast and finding one's

Looking up, one can admire the majestic trees in all there splendor.  Nowhere

Approaching the shoreline, the trees give way to delicious berry bushes as well
as other plants that can only grow in full sun.  The animals are more plentiful
here as well given the variety of food.  There are huge paw prints in the dirt,
