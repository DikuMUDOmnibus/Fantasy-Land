You stand on a small and narrow path.  The path seems to cut through a
land of black sand.  Small fires sudden flare up and move towards you, only
to die out and reappear in a different place.  The path leads off East
towards some large trees, and West towards a sea of red.  There is a small
sign here, buried halfway in the dark black sands.

The Darkness of The Trees~
You find yourself amidst the trunks of tall trees that span over you like
looming giants, threatening to fall down around you at any momment.  The
trees' bark is black and many small insects or other vile creatures that
you've never seen before reside.  The thick grey fog rolls in around you,
blocking your view for any distance.  You can see that to the West, the
forest drops off into a flat black sand-like region that seems to be ablaze
with an odd fire.  The path also continues to the East, deeper into the dark
forest.

The Dark Trees~
You seem lost as you stand on a small path that seems to cut through a
thick forest.  You seem to know that if you left the visibility of the path
that you might be eternally lost in the deep confines of the dark trees.  A
thick haze seems to roll from deep withing the forest, rolling between the
trees as if it sought to smother everything it could.  The Main path
continues East and West, while you notice a small narrow path that leads
North.

The Small Path~
The ground below you seems damp as you walk upon a small trail leading
North and South.  All around you, stand tall black barked trees that seem to
hide things born of nightmares.  A pair of red eyes can be seen off to the
left as if they were watching you, but suddenly vanish without a trace.  To
the North, you can make out the shape of some sort of structure obscured by
the fog.  South leads off into the forest.

You find yourself in front of a huge cottage.  The cottage appears run
down and not to have been used in some time.  As you look closer, you can
see that someone or something has destroyed this once majestic cottage.  The
doors and walls seem to have shattered with great force.  You could see what
lays inside if not for the thick haze that obscures your vision.  South
leads you on a small trail back into the trees.

a barren shell of something that once was.  The walls looks as if something
smashed through it without an problem at all.  All along the walls, you can
see deep scratches and holes as if something with sharp swords came.  You
know a great battle took place inside this dwelling, but as to who the
victor was, you can only guess.  A battered doorway lies to the South.  A
sudden rattling noise to the North tells you that you are not alone in this
place.

piles, some more fresh than others telling by the bits of flesh and meat
hanging from the bones.  A crunching noise seems to be drawing closer and
closer to you.  Coming at you at a steady pace.  The only exit seems to be

wall.  Small pointed arrows stick out of the hole, all pointed at you.  A
small sign is stuck into the ground.  A large gate lies to the South.

of slim elves, all battle-clad and ready to defend.  They appear worn down
and tired, but the determination in their eyes tells you they will fight to
the death.  You see large gates to the West and East.

the fog again.  Voices are coming from the North.  A large gate lies to the

from attritious wounds.  Some are missing limbs or have huge wounds.  It

Some are missing limbs or having gaping holes in them.  The path bends to

forest open up to a large open field.  Out in the field, what seems like
countless tents surround the field.  Elven soldiers march around everywhere.

surround a large valley.  Millions of tents are pitched there.  Banners fly
in the wind, dividing the great elven army into regiments.  Elven soldiers
stand everywhere, knowing that they will soon go to battle their enemy.  The
path goes West, leading back into the dark forest.

grass is blackened as if mighty fires burnt the life from this place.  As
you near the center of the Battle ravaged camp the grass begins to turn into
a brilliant green, as if some great magics were being used to preserve the
natural beauty that once was.  Surrounding the camp are sixteen very tall,
black trees that appear to hold the very skies in there black limbs. 
Somewhere far, far in the distance sounds of a great battle ring in your
ears leaving the sounds of death and misery in your head.  The path you are
on continues East but something inside makes you want to turn back into the
safety of the forests to the West.

elven soldiers begin to rise up from everywhere.  Each tent has a special
banner representing the regiment they serve.  To the North, a tent with a
bright yellow banner lies.  The banner has a large green shield on it.  To
the South, a tent is found with the same yellow banner.

entire army is based out of small valley.  Hundreds of tents line the
pathway, filling the valley's entirety.  Each area is sectioned of by their
purpose, and marked with different colored banners that flow in the breeze. 
A small pathway leads to the North and another to the East.  A path leading
west seems wider, and leads back into the darkness of the forest.

a fenched in circle of dirt.  As you push through the crowd, you can see a
large demonic looking creature fighting a pair of elven warriors.  The crowd
around you seem to be betting on the outcome of this interesting fight.  A

are about to face.  You keep hearing The words "Darwaza" and "demons" alot.

The Reddened Walkway~
You find yourself standing in a large hallway.  The walls are of a deep
red that seem to have been fashioned out of some sort of clay.  There are
many holes along the way, as if something are placed in these holes.  The
hallway is lined by many blazing torches that oddly seem not to emit any
sort of smoke at all.  The hallway continues East and West.  You can hear
the sounds of water to the East.

The Unholy Docks~
You are standing on a large wooden plank of sorts.  It seems to stretch
to the East for a bit, then drops off into a vast sea of blood red water. 
The water seems to be extremely hot as it churns and boils sending a pugnent
odor in the air as the liquid bubbles to the surface and pops.  Across the
water far to the East, you can see land jetting out of the water like a
giant head rising.  There is an archway that leads off to the West.

The Sea of Fire~
You are upon a vast sea of red.  The water below you seems to be boiling
from heat as small bubbles rise to the surface, then explode in a small
fireball.  There are now waves or currents at all and everything about it
seems so stagnant, but some sort of force seems to be pulling you to the
East.  You could probably get to the docks to the West also with little
difficulty.

A Tree Limb~
You are trying to balance on a thin tree limb.  Below you the ground
appears to be wat far away and the slightest slip and you could be pummeling
to your death.  You can see small whips of cloud slowly float by you.  Out
on a further limb you think you can see a chest.  A dark hole can be seen in
the base of the limb.

The Mist Caves~
You find yourself having the feeling of depression and lost as you
emmense yourself in the thickness of the fog.  It swarms around you like a
cold wet blanket, trying to smother your body and soul.  You can feel your
travels downward but everything around you seems to be out of focus,
confusing your thought process.  You can see roots of trees.  They resemble
long tentacles seeking out nutrients from the soil.  Small bugs and other
various things can be seen crawling around.  The entirety of the tunnel is
lit with an eerie green from the wierd algae that grows upon the walls.  The
Tunnel continues South, North, and East, with what appears to be a large
gaping hole leading Up.

The Underground Sanctuary~
You stand in a small deadended cave.  The walls here are brick opposed to
the earthen walls that would be expected.  THe floor is also made of small
white bricks that seem quite clean.  The whole room seems to be bathed in a
glowing aura that seems to be emitted from a small creek that run on from
the Eastern wall.  Even the air here seems clean and quite pleasant.  There
is an exit that leads off to the West but what lies out there is blocked
from your vision by a dense rolling fog.

The Mist Caves~
You are standing in a mist enshrouded cave.  All around you a thick fog
rolls in, blocking off your visibility of the exits out.  The fog is of a
blackish color and the air is cold.  It seems to cling to you like some sort
of magical cobweb, trying to choke the life out of you.  A howl followed by
another seems to break out from the mist, but you can't tell from which
direction it came.

The Mist Enshrouded Junction~
You seem to have stumbled onto a small junction of sorts.  All around
you, hints of exits and branching tunnels can barely be seen from beyond the
mist.  The mist seems to get much thicker South as if it is becoming a solid
mass.  The Eastern direction smells of dampness and a small grinding noise
can be heard far off.  To the West, a baying can be heard from beyond the
fog.  The North seems quiet and you almost think the mist is somehow
clearing up.

The Darker Hall~
You find yourself surrounded by a thick blackish mist that seems to roll
in at you from all directions.  You begin to feel as if the mist itself has
some sort of mind, seeking to choke the life out of you instead of just
flowing.  Further in the Eastern direction, there can be heard an awful
grinding noise, that somewhat resembles that of grinding bones.

The Grinders~
You emerge from the dense mist only to be standing in front of some
twisted display.  In front of you, stands a huge metal contraption.  It has
pipes and huge metal beams protruding from almost everywhere.  The metal of
the huge mechanical thing is made of all sorts of different types, showing
that the materials were scavenged from all over the realms.  You spot things
of Navarian and Havian make all intermixed into the great menacing thing. 
From the back of this thing, you can see the source of all the mist in this
land.  Two huge pipes seem to be spewing forth the mist, spreading it out
everywhere.  You then notice two sets of small eyes sticking out of the
machine.  Apparently the operators of the odd thing.  You can see the
entrance inside the thing in the front of it.

The Inner Contraption~
You find yourself inside a huge metallic space.  Everywhere you look, you
can see various pipes and beams of all sorts of metals sticking here and
there.  The room itself seems to hum and vibrate as if alive.  At the rear
of the room, you can see various writings and glyphs unknown to you.  In the
center of the strange room, you can see two large chairs set in the dead
center of the room.  They look as if they can swivel all the way around,
giving access to those that sit in them to almost anything inside.  The
machine's exit seems to glow a bright green.

The Baying Winds~
You are standing in what seems a never ending bank of fog.  It's thick
and of a black color and seems to roll in at you from all sides.  It chills
you to the bone and it's dampness clings to your body.  Out of the fog, you
can hear the sounds of an eerie howling or baying, then followed by another.
They seem to be coming from all around you, but they could be echoing off
the walls, making you think that.

The Whispered Winds~
From all around you, the mists seem to encircle you.  It's thick rolling
black material seems to come right at you instead of floating aimlessly,
giving you the feeling it is alive.  As you survey the area for your next
course of direction, you see what appears to be the shape of a dog, then
another appears.  They seem to judging your power as they begin to slowly
circle you.  Then one let's out an eerie howl, and they all see to draw back
into the darkness of the mist to the West.

The Mist Hounds' Den~
You find yourself in a small dead end cave.  The Mist here has somewhat
disappated letting you actually see what's in the room.  About the floor you
can see bones scattered here and there.  They seem to be clean of any type
of meat or skin.  You see many humanoid type skulls, making you know that
they were once humans.  Suddenly a growl echoes out, followed by another and
another.  The only exit seems to be back through the thick mist.

The Large Mist Tunnel~
A sudden splash sounds as you find yourself walking in a large pool of
water.  Mist seems to continously roll in from unknown sources, obscuring
your vision of anything around you.  Out in the less dense parts of the fog,
you can see things that resemble tentacles hanging from the earthen roof. 
As you peer closer, you realize that they are nothing more than mere roots
from trees above you.  You think the tunnel continues both North and South.

The Stagnant Fog~
You find yourself feeling confused and lost with no sense of direction as
you wander in these mist filled tunnels.  This mist itself is of a dark
black color as if it were created from a huge blazing fire, but it's cold
and damp and seems to cling to your skin.  The sounds of water dripping can
be heard off in the distance but as for which direction it's coming from you
can't be certain.

You find yourself walking in what appears to be a large tunnel.  You
vaguely can make out the earthen walls around you, for a thick rolling mist
seems to roll in from everywhere, blocking off your line of sight.  As you
wait a momment to gain your bearings, you suddenly feel a really cold wind
blow past you, chilling you to the bone.

The Smaller Junction~
You are standing in a small junction.  All about you, a thick fog or mist
seems to linger in the air, making it virtually impossible to see anything
beyond it.  As you try desperately to see you think you see two exits
branching off to the East and West.  You also think that the main tunnel
continues North and South also.

You find yourself standing in a large cavernous room.  
The fog seems to be disipating a bit as you can finally breathe a bit easier. But you soon realize that there is no other exit in the room except towards the East, which leads back into the thick mist.

disipating.  You can still see the black wisps of it drift here and there,
mostly coming from the West.

You are standing in a large underground tunnel.  The walls and floor you
can't see due to a billowing black mist that seems to roll in at you from
all directions.  It feels damp to the touch as it crawls across your flesh. 
You can make out that the tunnel continues North and South further. 
Something moves South of you, as if it were trying to conceal itself even
more into the mist.

All around you a thick black mist creeps up on you from all directions. 
As you look around, you notice you are standing in some sort of large
cavernous room.  The walls seem to be made of an earthen material, but the
fog prevents you from being sure.  In the ceiling you notice there is a huge
trap door.  The door is adorned with many glyphs and wards, and each glows a
bright gold.  There apparently seems to be a strong magic keeping the door
closed tight.  The tunnel also continues to the North.

The Dark Cellars~
You are standing in a large cellar.  Along the walls are large racks that
appear to hold a massive amount of bottled wine and other liquors.  Many of
the bottles are smashed and seem to have been destryoed long ago.  Those
that remain are so covered in cobwebs that you can barely even tell what
they are.  The cellar itself continues in all directions.  You also see a
small spiralling staircase leading up in the center of the room.

You are standing in a large room.  There are cobwebs and dust everywhere,
making it appear that no one has been in this room for quite some time. 
Along the walls, large racks of wine stand from floor to ceiling.  Many of
the bottles on the racks seem to have destroyed, leaving small shards of
glass everywhere on the floor.  The cellar continues to the South.  One of
the wine racks seem to be a bit perculiar looking, and doesn't seem to be
what it appears.

time.  They are covered in a thick layer of dust and cobwebs.  The room

here in some time.  Along the walls, you can see numerous bookshelves that
hold countless volumes of ancient literature.  A few seem to catch your
interest, but most are written in a long forgotten language.  You can also
see a large desk wedged in between two of the bookshelves.  To the South, an
odd looking book shelf is open slightly, revealing a secret passage.
