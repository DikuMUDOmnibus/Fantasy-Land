Pteranodons were flying reptiles (pterosaurs) that were about 6 feet (1. 
8 m) long, had a 25 foot (7.  8 m) wingspread, and weighed about 35 pounds. 
This wing-span is longer than any known bird.  They had hollow bones, were
lightly built, had almost no tail, and small bodies.  They may have had fur.
They had large brains and good eyesight.  Some pteranodons had long,
light-weight, bony crests on their heads that may have acted as a rudder or
stabilizer when flying, or may have been a sexual characteristic.  They had
no teeth.

An apatosaurus is here.
~
Apatosaurus could have held its head at most 17 feet (5.  4 m) off the
ground (Parrish and Stevens,1999).  This afforded Apatosaurus protection
from predators, since most couldn't attach its head or neck, and probably
had more sense than to attack its gigantic, clawed feet or whip-like tail. 
Strangely, Apatosaurus' nostrils were located on the top of its head. 
Device for a water-dwelling animal, but this theory has been repudiated. 
Since Apatosaurus fossils have been found far from any water-dwelling
fossils, it is now believed that Apatosaurus spent most of its time on land,
far from large bodies of water or swamps.

Triceratops was a rhinoceros-like dinosaur.  It walked on four sturdy
legs and had three horns on its face along with a large bony plate
projecting from the back of its skull (a frill).  One short horn above its
parrot-like beak and two longer horns above its eyes probably provided
protection from predators, and were possibly used in mating rivalry and
rituals.  It had a large skull, up to 10 feet (3 m) long, one of the largest
skulls of any land animal ever discovered.  Its head was nearly one-third as
long as its body.  Triceratops hatched from eggs.  Triceratops was about 30
feet long (9 m), 10 feet tall (3 m), and weighed up to 6-12 tons.  It had a
short, pointed tail, a bulky body, column-like legs with hoof-like claws,
and a bony neck frill rimmed with bony bumps.  It had a parrot-like beak,
many cheek teeth, and powerful jaws.

Tyrannosaurus rex was a fierce predator that walked on two powerful legs
in Cretaceous period forests.  This meat-eater had a huge head with large,
pointed, replaceable teeth and well-developed jaw muscles.  It had tiny
arms, each with two fingers.  Each bird-like foot had three large toes, all
equipped with claws.  T.  Rex had a slim, stiff, pointed tail that provided
balance and allowed quick turns while running.  T.  Rex's neck was short and
muscular.  Its body was solidly built but its bones were hollow. 
Tyrannosaurus rex was up to 40 feet (12.  4 m) long, about 15 to 20 feet (4.
6 to 6 m) tall.  It was roughly 5 to 7 tons in weight.  T.  Rex left
footprints 1.  55 feet (46 cm) long (although its feet were much longer,
about 3.  3 feet (1 m) long, T.  Rex, like other dinosaurs walked on its
toes).

~
Allosaurus was a powerful predator that walked on two powerful legs, had
a strong, s- shaped neck, and had vertebrae that were different from those
of other dinosaurs (hence its name, the "different lizard").  It had a
massive tail, a bulky body, and heavy bones.  Its arms were short and had
three-fingered hands with sharp claws that were up to 6 inches (15 cm) long.
Allosaurus was up to 38 feet long (12 m) and 16.  5 feet tall (5 m).  It
weighed about 1400 kg.  It had a 3 feet long (90 cm) skull with two short
brow-horns and bony knobs and ridges above its eyes and on the top of the
head.  It had large, powerful jaws with long, sharp, serrated teeth 2 to 4
inches (5 to 10 cm) long.  The different species of Allosaurus varied in
weight.  Allosaurus fragilis, A.  Atrox, and A.  Ferox weighed about 1.  1
to 1.  9 tons (1 tonne to 1.  7 tonnes); A.  Amplexus was much heavier and
weighed about 2.  7 to 5.  5 tons (3 tonnes to 5 tonnes).  Allosaurus was
very common, and was the biggest meat-eater in North America during the late
Jurassic period.

Brachiosaurus was one of the tallest and largest dinosaurs yet found.  It
had a long neck, small head, and relatively short, thick tail.  It walked on
four legs and, like the other Brachiosaurids and unlike most dinosaurs, its
front legs were longer than its hind legs.  These unusual front legs
together with its very long neck gave Brachiosaurus a giraffe-like stance
and great height, up to 40-50 feet tall (12-16 m).  Brachiosaurus was about
85 feet long (26 m), and weighed about 50-80 tons.  Like other
Brachiosaurids, it had chisel-like teeth, its nostrils were on the top of
its head, and it had large nasal openings indicating that it may have had a
good sense of smell.  Brachiosaurus had 26 teeth on top jaw and 26 on the
bottom for a total of 52 teeth.  It had a claw on the first toe of each
front foot and claws on the first three toes of each rear foot (each foot
had five toes with fleshy pads).

Diplodocus was a long-necked, whip-tailed giant, measuring about 90 feet
(27 m) long with a 26 foot (8 m) long neck and a 45 foot (14 m) long tail,
but its head was less than 2 feet long.  It was among the longest land
animals ever.  Its nostrils were at at the top of its head and it had
peg-like teeth, but only in the front of the jaws.  Its front legs were
shorter than its back legs, and all had elephant-like, five-toed feet.  One
toe on each foot had a thumb claw, probably for protection It was more
lightly built than the other giant sauropods, and may have weighed only
about 10-20 tons.  Its backbone had extra bones underneath it, which had
bony protrusions running both forwards and backwards (anvil shaped), a
"double beam", probably for support and extra mobility of its neck and tail.
It may have used its whip-like tail for protection.

agile, bipedal (walked on two legs), bird-like dinosaur.  It had a curved,
flexible neck, and a big head with sharp, serrated teeth in very powerful
jaws.  The second toe on each foot had a 14 inch (35 cm) sickle-like claw
and the other toes had smaller claws.  When alive, this claw would have been
sheathed in a horny, keratinous material much like our fingernails, making
the claw even bigger, longer and sharper.  The long tail was used for
balance and fast turning ability.  It had a relatively large brain and
large, keen, eyes.  Megaraptor was about 20-26 feet (6-8 m) long.

Stegosaurus measured up to 26-30 feet long (8-9 m), about 9 feet tall (2.
75 m), and weighed about 6,800 pounds (3100 kg).  Its small brain was only
the size of a walnut (weighing roughly 2.  5 - 2.  9 ounces (70 - 80 grams).
Its skull was long and narrow; it had a toothless beak and small cheek
teeth.  Its head was carried close to the ground, probably no more than 3
feet (1 m) high.  Stegosaurus had 17 bony plates that were embedded in its
back.  Since they were not attached to its bones, no one is sure exactly how
they were positioned.  Also, the function of these plates is uncertain.  The
plates were made of bone which was not solid, but was filled with tube-like
tunnels.  The plates were prbobaly well- nourished by blood vessels,
indicating that the plates may have been used to regulate the dinosaur's
temperature.  They may have also been used for protection or mating display
purposes.  Stegosaurus also had tail spikes at the end of its flexible tail.
These spikes were up to four feet long and were used for protection from
predators.  Different species of Stegosaurus had different numbers of tail
spikes; Stegosaurus ungulatis had 8 spikes and Stegosaurus stenops had 4
spikes.  Stegosaurus' rear legs were longer and straighter than its front
legs, which sprawled out to the sides.  The forefeet (the feet of the front
legs) had five short, wide toes with short, hoof-like tips.  The rear feet
had three short, wide toes with hooves.

smartest dinosaur, having the largest brain in proportion to its body weight
(as smart as a modern bird).  It was a theropod about 6 feet (1.  75 m) long
and may have weighed about 110 pounds (50 kg).  This light-weight dinosaur
had long hind legs and a stiff tail.  Trodon had large eyes and may have had
a good sense of hearning.  It had a large, sickle-shaped toe claw on its
second toe, and smaller ones on the other.  It had three long, clawed
fingers that were ideal for grasping prey.

arms with three-fingered clawed hands and four-toed clawed feet. 
Velociraptor may have been able to run up to roughly 40 mph (60 km/hr) for
short bursts.  Velociraptor was about 6 feet long (2 m), and 3 feet tall (1
m).  It may have weighed about 15 to 33 pounds (7 to 15 kg).  It had a stiff
tail that worked as a counterbalance and let it make very quick turns. 
Velociraptor brains were very large in comparison to their body size (this
is true for all the Dromaeosaurid dinosaurs, who were the most intelligent
dinosaurs).

Archaeopteryx (meaning "ancient wing") is a very early prehistoric bird,
dating from about 150 million years ago during the Jurassic period, when
many dinosaurs lived.  It is one of the oldest-known birds.  Archaeopteryx
seemed to be part bird and part dinosaur.  Unlike modern-day birds, it had
teeth, three claws on each wing, a flat sternum (breastbone), belly ribs
(gastralia), and a long, bony tail.  Like modern-day birds, it had feathers,
a lightly-built body with hollow bones, a wishbone (furcula) and reduced
fingers.  This crow-sized animal may have been able to fly, but not very far
and not very well.  Although it had feathers and could fly, it had
similarities to dinosaurs, including its teeth, skull, lack of horny bill,
and certain bone structures.  Archaeopteryx had a wingspan of about 1.  5
feet (0.  5 m) and was about 1 foot ( 30 cm) long from beak to tail.

Acanthopholis (meaning "spiny scales") was an armored, quadrupedal

period.  Its armor was rows of oval plates set into its skin, plus it had
spikes jutting out of its neck and shoulder area along the spine.  It was
about 15 feet long (4 m) and weighed roughly 380 kg.  This huge, heavy
reptile was an herbivore (it ate only plants).  It had to eat a huge amount
of low-lying plant material to sustain itself so its gut must have been very
large.  It probably had a fermentation compartment to aid in the digestion
of the tough plant material, producing prodigious amounts of gas.

Acrocanthosaurus (meaning "high-spine lizard" because of the spikes
growing out of its spine) was a fierce predator that was roughly 30-40 feet
(9-12 m) long and weighed about 5,000 pounds (2300 kg).  It had a big head,
with a 4.  5 foot (1.  4 m) long skull and 68 thin, sharp, serrated teeth. 
It had 17-inch (43 cm) spikes extending from its vertebrae, along the neck
and tail, that may have formed a thick, fleshy sail on its back.  It had
powerful arms, and each hand had three fingers, equipped with long,
sickle-like claws.

Albertosaurus, also known as Gorgosaurus, was a relative of Tyrannosaurus
rex; Albertosaurus was smaller than T.  Rex and lived a few million years
earlier.  Albertosaurus walked on two legs and had a large head with sharp,
saw-toothed teeth.  It had two-fingered hands on short arms.  Its long tail
provided balance and quick turning.  It had powerful back legs with clawed,
three-toed feet.  Albertosaurus was about 30 feet (9 m) long, about 11 feet
(3.  4 m) tall at the hips, and up to 3 tons in weight (averaging roughly
2500 kg).  The lower jaw of Albertosaurus had from 14 and 16 teeth; the
upper jaw had 17-19 teeth.  It had one row of teeth in each jaw but had at
least one replacement tooth growing up from under each tooth.

~
Amargasaurus (named from La Armaga, a canyon in Argentina where the
fossil was found) was a sauropod from the early Cretaceous period.  This
plant-eater was about 33 feet (10 m) long and weighed roughly 5000 kg.  It
had 2 rows of spines growing out along its backbone along its neck, body,
and tail.  These spines may have have a covering of skin forming a sail (or
two).  If so, this sail might have been a thermoregulatory structure, used
to absorb and release heat, for mating and dominance rituals, and/or for
making it look much larger than it was to predators.  Otherwise, the spines
may have been useful as protection.  Amargasaurus was a quadruped (it walked
on four legs), had a small head, a long neck and a very long tail.  Its
front legs were shorter than its back legs, and all the legs had
elephant-like, five-toed feet.  One toe on each foot had a thumb claw,
probably for protection.  It may have used its whip-like tail for
protection.

lightly built and with longer legs.  It had short arms, a long, pointy tail,
three hoofed toes, mitten-like hands, a flat, sloping head with a toothless
beak, cheek pouches, and hundreds of closely-packed cheek teeth that ground
up its food.  It was a biped (it walked on two legs) that could also walk on
four legs, perhaps to graze low-lying plants.  Anatotitan was a slow-moving
dinosaur with few defenses, but may have had keen senses (eyesight, hearing,
and smell) to help it avoid predators.

teeth (this is 1.  5 times the number teeth that most other theropod had). 
It had a small crest on its snout.  It had a long, straight neck (unlike
other theropods, who had s-shaped necks) and a long tail.  Its low-slung
body was supported by 2 large rear legs and 2 slightly smaller arms.  It was
a carnivorous dinosaur from the early Cretaceous period, about 125 million
years ago.  Baryonyx was a predator about 30 feet long (10 m), weighing 2
tons or more.

and weighing up to 20 tons (roughly 28000 kg).  It was much smaller than its
fellow sauropods.  It had a small, long head with a blunt snout and
spoon-shaped teeth.  Its neck and tail were shorter than most other
sauropods.  It had thick legs with five-toed feet; the inner toe had a long,
sharp claw for protection.  The front legs were only a bit shorter than its
back legs, making its back almost level to the ground.  Its name, "chambered
lizard," comes from the holes in its vertebrae that decrease its weight.

a helmet flattened on the sides (Corythosaurus means "helmet lizard"). 
Corythosaurus' nostrils went up through the crest.  The crest may have been
used to make sounds, as a cooling device, courtship displays, and/or as a
sense-of-smell enhancer.  Males had larger crests than females and
juveniles.  It had a toothless beak and hundreds of cheek teeth that it used

a gigantosaurus carolinii~
A behemoth of a dinosaur shatters the earth as it walks around clumsily.
~
The biggest meat-eating dinosaur ever discovered is Giganotosaurus, a
47-foot long behemoth, who weighed about 8 tons and stood 12 feet tall (at
the hips).  It walked on two legs, had a brain the size of a banana, and had
enormous jaws with 8-inch long serrated teeth in a 6 feet (1.  8 m) long
skull.  Giganotosaurus was a theropod from the mid-Cretaceous, living about
100-95 million years ago, toward the end of the Mesozoic Era, the "Age of
Reptiles".  Giganotosaurus was probably bigger than Tyrannosaurus rex , who
was about 40-50 feet long, about 5 tons in weight and about 10 feet tall at
the hips.  Giganotosaurus, however, was more lightly built and had a much
smaller brain case.  Giganotosaurus lived about 30 million years before
Tyrannosaurus rex, which was among the last of the dinosaur species alive
before the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction 65 million years ago.

Homalocephale was a thick-skulled, plant-eating dinosaur.  Its flat head
housed a very thick skull, a tiny brain, and large eyes.  The skull
consisted of porous, non-rigid bone interlaced with blood vessels. 
Homalocephale grew to be about 5 feet long (1.  5 m) and weighed about 95
pounds (43 kg).  Homalocephale probably had a good sense of smell.  It had
bumpy knobs on its snout and along the rear of its skull.  It had
leaf-shaped teeth, short forelimbs and stiff tail.  Running and
flank-butting (ramming into an enemy's body with the head) were probably the
first line of self-defense.

Hylaeosaurus (meaning "woodland lizard") was an armored, quadrupedal,
plant-eating dinosaur from the early Cretaceous period, about 135-119
million years ago.  It looked a lot like its more advanced relative
Ankylosaurus, but didn't have the bony nodes at the end of its tail or horns
on its head.  It had a toothless horny beak and leaf-shaped cheek. 
Hylaeosaurus was about 13 feet (4 m) long, had short legs, a narrow head
with a pointed snout, a long, heavy tail, spikes along its shoulders and
sides, and horn-covered oval plates embedded in its skin all over the top of
its body.  Its entire top side was heavily protected from predators.  Only
its under-belly was unplated.  Flipping it over was the only way to wound
it.

3/4 inch (12 cm) long, by 2 inch (5 cm) wide.  Hypsilophodon may have had 2
rows of bony plates running down its back.  Slender legs and a stiffened
tail gave it speed and agility.  It had large eyes, strong jaws,
five-fingered hands and four-toed feet (one with a hind claw). 
Hypsilophodon was a very fast bi-pedal (two-legged) runner; its back legs

A janenschia eats leaves from the tallest trees.
~
Janenschia (named after Werner Janensch) was a giant plant-eating
dinosaur.  This enormous dinosaur had a long neck, and a long tail.  It was
about 80 feet (24 m) long.  Janenschia walked on four thick legs.  The
hindlimbs had claws that were up to 4 3/4 feet (1.  38 m) long.  Janenschia,
like some other titanosaurids, may have been covered with armored scales,
but there is no fossils evidence of this.  Although many sauropods may have
travelled in herds, bonebeds of Janenschia fossils have not been found -
only an incomplete fossil has been unearthed.  Janenschia may have been a
solitary animal.  This huge dinosaur was an herbivore (it ate only plants). 
It must have eaten a tremendous amount of plant material each day to sustain
itself.  It swallowed leaves whole, without chewing them, and may have had
gastroliths (stomach stones) in its stomachs to help digest this tough plant
material.

~
Kentrosaurus measured up to 17 feet long (5 m) and weighed about 2 tons,
but its small brain was the size of a walnut.  Its skull was long and
narrow, with a toothless beak and small cheek teeth.  Its head was carried
close to the ground.  It had hoof-like claws on its toes.  Kentrosaurus had
two rows of bony plates that were embedded in its back, that went from its
neck to its mid-section.  A double row of spikes ran from its mid-section to
its tail, and a pair spikes protected its shoulders.  Since these were not
attached to its bones, no one is sure exactly how they were positioned. 
Also, the function of the plates is uncertain; perhaps they were for
temperature regulation, since they contained networks of blood vessels, or
maybe they were for protection or mating display purposes.  The spikes were
used as protection from predators.  Kentrosaurus walked slowly on four legs.
Its back legs were twice as long as its front legs; this probably allowed
the dinosaur to stand up briefly on its hind legs to forage for high
vegetation.

Mamenchisaurus was a long-necked, long-tailed, quadrupedal, plant-eating
dinosaur.  Mamenchisaurus had the longest neck of any known dinosaur, except
the newly found Sauroposeidon.  Mamenchisaurus' neck was about 46 feet (14
m).  It had 19 vertebrae in its neck, more than any other known dinosaur
had.  Mamenchisaurus was about 70 to 80 feet (21 to 25 m) long and weighed
roughly 12 tons (11 tonnes).  Its hind legs were longer than the front legs;
these hind legs were similar to the legs of Diplodocus.  Its skull however,
was box-shaped (unlike Diplodocus' elongated snout).  Mamenchisaurus was an
herbivore (it ate only plants).  It must have eaten a tremendous amount of
plant material each day to sustain itself.  It swallowed leaves whole,
without chewing them, and may have had gastroliths (stomach stones) in its

Cliffs~
The edge of the island rears its head suddenly as the earth drops
suddenly 40 feet to the ocean below.  The pounding of the surf crashing
against the walls is thunderous.  To the south the jungle forms a neat line
as though afraid to come near the edge lest it too falls to the rocks below.

The rolling surf crashes gently up the beautiful white beaches.  Long
expanses run across the entire length of the island like a shield against

creature checking out the sea or the carcass of a large animal that may have
washed ashore, even now being fed apon by the scavengers on the island.  The

The Jungle~
Enormous trees threaten to eclipse out the sun during the day and
enshroud the jungle in pitch black darkness at night.  Grass grows in odd
patches on the ground and strange red and orange flowers provide the only
distinct colorings in the jungle.  Everything else seems to meld together.

A mountain~
A small mountain errupts at the edge of the jungle.  Large paths have
been carved into it's sides from violent lava flows in ages past.  Plants
grow sporadically, timidly trying to reclaim their place amongst the rocks. 
The slope is too steep to climb here making the only choice back to the
jungles to the north, east and west or further around the mountain.

A mountain~
A small mountain errupts at the edge of the jungle.  Large paths have
been carved into it's sides from violent lava flows in ages past.  Plants
grow sporadically, timidly trying to reclaim their place amongst the rocks. 
The slope is too steep to climb here making the only choice back to the
jungles to the north, east and west or further around the mountain.

The Jungle~
Enormous trees threaten to eclipse out the sun during the day and
enshroud the jungle in pitch black darkness at night.  Grass grows in odd
patches on the ground and strange red and orange flowers provide the only
distinct colorings in the jungle.  Everything else seems to meld together.

A path through the Jungle~
A rather large animal path seems to cut its way through the dense foliage
of the jungle.  The ground has been trampled clear through such that a find
sand path has been worn.  It is not clear what created the path but it is
obvious that it was large.  The path seems to run in an north-south route.

A large jumble of rocks has fallen here as though blown from the top of

large nest has been made.  The ledge continues east and west.  There appears
to be no way down short of falling.

Mountain~
The edge of the mountain drops off quite steeply here making access up
and down fairly impossible.  A slight breeze is mixed with a tinge of sulfur
making ones eyes sting when sweat enters them.  A narrow ledge runs in a
north-south direction.

From the top of the mountain one can see for miles in every direction. 
The blue disc of the ocean surrounds the island like a mother its young. 
Far to the east of the island you can see a rising plateau and the swamps to
the southeast.  The well defined cliffs difine the northern border while to
the west a sandy beach glistens like snow.  The mating call of what sounds
to be a very large animal echos in the distance.

The mountain rises less steeply here allowing for access further up.  The
jungle rises up to the west and north while to the south a large flow of
lava impeeds further progress.

The mountain~
The mountain begins to rise steadily here above what is now evidently
obvious, an island.  Lose rocks make the footing somewhat treacherous but
most of the rock is smoothed from ancient lava flows.  A still flowing
stream of magma blocks access south but the mountain continues to wind
around to the north.  The ground slopes fairly gently back down towards the
jungle floor here while also granting further access to the top of the
mountain.

The top of the mountain~
The mountain shudders in anger.  You realize that you are walking on the
edge of a volcano.  The lava has hardened enough to cover the erruption
hole, but it is evident that nothing can contain the fury of the volcano for
much longer.  You'd better get out while you can!  The flow of lava heads
southward and west down the mountain.

expanses run across the entire length of the island like a shield against
the harshness of the sea.  The surface is perfect save for the occation
creature checking out the sea or the carcass of a large animal that may have
washed ashore, even now being fed apon by the scavengers on the island.  The
jungle comes right to the shore to the southwest.

Lava meets the Sea~
There is no way out.  Here the seething lava meets the cold sea causing
the molten rock to cool down almost instantly, trapping anything within its
grasp.  Your only hope now is to pray the gods are watching as you attempt
to recall.

Lava~
The lava flow burst from the mountain here in a tumultous, seething mass
of molten earth.  The heat is unbearable and the pull drags anything in its

Top of the Mountain~
From the top of the mountain one can see for miles in every direction. 
The blue disc of the ocean surrounds the island like a mother its young. 
Far to the east of the island you can see a rising plateau and the swamps to
the southeast.  The well defined cliffs difine the northern border while to
the west a sandy beach glistens like snow.  The mating call of what sounds
to be a very large animal echos in the distance.  A large flow of lave makes
its way down the mountain to the west while step edges make the only path
open northward.

A mountain~
A small mountain errupts at the edge of the jungle.  Large paths have
been carved into it's sides from violent lava flows in ages past.  Plants
grow sporadically, timidly trying to reclaim their place amongst the rocks. 
The slope is too steep to climb here making the only choice back to the
jungles to the north and east or further around the mountain.

The Jungle~
Enormous trees threaten to eclipse out the sun during the day and

obvious, an island.  Lose rocks make the footing somewhat treacherous but
most of the rock is smoothed from ancient lava flows.  A still flowing
stream of magma blocks access north but the mountain continues to wind
around to the east.  The ground slopsfairly gently back down towards the

Tall thin grasses eclipse most of the view.  Moss hangs down from immense
trees and entwines itself within the tall grasses creating a psuedo wall
around the jungle.  The earth trembles and shakes and loud baying sounds can
be heard from within the wetlands.

Sandy Beach~
The rolling surf crashes gently up the beautiful white beaches.  Long
expanses run across the entire length of the island like a shield against
the harshness of the sea.  The surface is perfect save for the occation
creature checking out the sea or the carcass of a large animal that may have
washed ashore, even now being fed apon by the scavengers on the island.  The
jungle comes right to the shore to the west.

The Jungle~
Enormous trees threaten to eclipse out the sun during the day and
enshroud the jungle in pitch black darkness at night.  Grass grows in odd
patches on the ground and strange red and orange flowers provide the only
distinct colorings in the jungle.  Everything else seems to meld together.

A mountain~
A small mountain errupts at the edge of the jungle.  Large paths have
been carved into it's sides from violent lava flows in ages past.  Plants
grow sporadically, timidly trying to reclaim their place amongst the rocks. 
The slope is too steep to climb here making the only choice back to the
jungles to the south, east and west or further around the mountain.

Tar Pits~
>>Plunk!!  << What at first appeared to be a small clearing in the jungle
turns out to be far more sinister.  It is the bane of all animals of
Jurrassis.  It is the enemy that cannot be defeated.  It is the tar pit. 
Its roiling surface sits calmly, covered enticingly with berries, till an
unsuspecting beast barges through the jungle.  Once in its grasp there is no
escape.  Vines hang tantalizingly close to the edge but in the end are
impossible to reach.  Slowly but as surely as the sun rises, whatever is in
grasp sinks to its depths below.

The Swamp~
The water underfoot is covered with a blue-green moss which parts as you
move around to reveal small swamp life in it's shallow waters.  Tall, tall,
trees eclipse the skies above, and long tendrils of greenery descend from
the tops of the trees to skim lightly along the water of the swamp.

Swampy Water~
This water is really mud more than anything else.  It is hard to tell
where the swamp ends and the water begins.  Long tendrils from the swamp
trees hang overhead like grizzly hands seeking something to grasp.  The
water here however is rich in food attracting beasts here to feed, both big
and huge.

Lagoon~
The water here is less clouded here than more towards the swamp.  The
wide expanse of the ocean can be seen to the southwest but here a small
coral reef keeps the waters much more stable.  The rising hulk of the island
is to the northwest while movement below hints at something unknown.

The Jungle~
Enormous trees threaten to eclipse out the sun during the day and
enshroud the jungle in pitch black darkness at night.  Grass grows in odd
patches on the ground and strange red and orange flowers provide the only
distinct colorings in the jungle.  Everything else seems to meld together.

creature checking out the sea or the carcass of a large animal that may have
washed ashore, even now being fed apon by the scavengers on the island.  The

creature checking out the sea or the carcass of a large animal that may have
washed ashore, even now being fed apon by the scavengers on the island.  To
the north can be seen some swampy ground.

Sandy Beach~
The rolling surf crashes gently up the beautiful white beaches.  Long

the harshness of the sea.  The surface is perfect save for the occation
creature checking out the sea or the carcass of a large animal that may have
washed ashore, even now being fed apon by the scavengers on the island.  To

Lagoon~
The water here is less clouded here than more towards the swamp.  The
wide expanse of the ocean can be seen to the southwest but here a small
coral reef keeps the waters much more stable.  The rising hulk of the island
is to the northwest while movement below hints at something unknown.

Beneath the Lagoon~
Strange rock formations and murky water give off an otherworldly feel
here beneath the waters of the lagoon.  Small fish creatures and waving beds
of some pinkish plant whirl about making it nearly impossible to
concentrate.  A few straining strands of sunlight manage to filter down from
aboving hinting at a possible escape route.

Benath the Tar Pits~
Blackness.  It is not readily apparent how one can even see down here but
it is safe to say it would be unwise to stay.  The murky blackness seems to
hold tight.  Drawing anything in its grasp into itself.  Escape is probably
impossible.  Best to sleep comfortablly in its embracing arms.  To sleep....
To sleep....  To sle....
