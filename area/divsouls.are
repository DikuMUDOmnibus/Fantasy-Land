sym jester~
Sym~
A lithe jester frolicks in the shadows.
~
A cartwheeling flurry slows momentarily to resolve itself into a slim,
green-clad figure crowned by a tassled jester's hat.  Stitched in gold
across the right and left breast pockets you notice the words:
"Sym"
and
"To wonder is to grow"
The left pocket is partially tinted with grass stains.

The chiseled face is upturned, the stone eyes gazing at nothing, as if lost

The little gnome appears to be a gardener.. that is, he dances around snipping
at things with no apparent plan or reason..  Surprisingly, the garden looks
well cared for, although those shears he's waving around look sort of lethal

Cellar~
The slick granite walls of a cold, dank cellar rise up around you.  Shelves,
stacked with cases of stored foods and beverages, line the walls.  Some
form of magical containment glimmers faintly above the shelves, both preserving
their contents and keeping nosy adventurers out..  Then again, considering
putrid odor permeating the cellar, you're not sure you really want to know
anymore about the contents..
