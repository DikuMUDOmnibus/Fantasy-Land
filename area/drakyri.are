A slender drakyri stands here, emanating {Cpower{x.

The brilliant silver eyes of the master Laerkai look deep into your

elite protective force of the race, a rank which she has won through
centuries of power and loyalty.  Though each of the six Laerkai beneath
her represents a single house and excels in that house's specialty,
the master comes from a union between the Deriki and Myrxes houses.
Trained by both, she has become a lethal blend of sorcery and stealth.

Blue marble, so dark as to appear black in patches where shadows have

sorceress, hands raised in the act of casting a spell.  Crystalline
water splashes from the sorceress' open palm, sparkling like colour
spray in the light.  The narrow face and chiseled cheekbones appear
elven, but twin wings rise from the shoulderblades, sculpted feathers
cascading over the sorceress' back like a cloak.
