thousands of feet beyond mortal sight.  A slight crack in the wall of the
mountain looks like a good place to explore.  Or is it?

This is one skinny little area with hardly enough room for a person to
fit through.  Beyond it in the dim light can be seen a larger opening, but
the fit seems to get tighter before the opening.

This is even tighter then the last few yards, but a cavern can be seem
just ahead.  The light here is dim, but upwards way up there is a stream of
light shining through what looks to be a man made hole.  The light seems to
shine right on through to the cavern then onto some rocks on the far side.

Entrance to the {yC{Da{yv{De{yr{Dn{x~
Water droplets can be seen and heard falling from the stalagmites and
stalagtites that adorn this whole cavern.  The only light that illuminates
this room comes from the light through the hole above head.  Ahead a few
steps the light hits the wall, to the nothwest lays a pool of refreshing
looking water.  Other non-distinguishable sounds can be heard in echos.

The ground is smooth from all of the years of water falling or running
over it.  The only obstacles are the sharp stalagmites protruding from the
ground.  There are glimmers from the rocks, that lay about, but sadly it's
only pirite, a flaky, shiny rock.

This is the middle of the cavern, where all can be seen..  And heard? 
The sound seem to be amplified here, and this is where most people figure
out that they are not alone in this cavern.  It must be animals of some sort
that got in, and live here.

Not a very big pool, but a pool none the less.  The water looks
refreshing, so clear it looks very deep.  Something at the bottom of the
pool looks shiny, but it's hard to tell because there is a rush of water
over the top as the springs pour into the pool

just as seen in a house, perfectly straight, and the walls are smooth. 
There seems to be less stalagmites protruding from the floor, and the rock
seems polished.  Looks almost like the

The light seen in the tight sqeeze to the cavern shines right on this
wall.  Drawn on this wall are ancient glyphs, so old that they do not even
show up in any records an adventurer may have.  The light shines right in
the middle of the glyph, and it shows upon a hole in the wall of this caven.
But of what use is this hole if you cannot make out the writting.  This is
where the adventure begins.
