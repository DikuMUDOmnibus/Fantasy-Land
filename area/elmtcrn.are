Salamanders are natives of the elemental plane of Fire, and thus they

Material plane for reasons known only to them.  The head and torso of a
salamander is copper-colored and has a human-like appearance.  Most of the
time (80%), this aspect is a male, with flaming beard and moustache.  The
female version has flowing, fiery red hair.  Both aspects have glowing
yellow eyes that sometimes switch to fluorescent green.  The lower torso is
that of a large snake, with orange coloring shading to dull red at the tail
end.  The entire body is covered with wispy appendages that appear to burn
but are never consumed.

A Tightly Fit Room~
The monstrous steel door to your south suddenly seals SHUT!  The air
around you suddenly feels shiverishly cold..  Like silent death.  A small
white misty cloud begins to surround you..  Almost like a stench of fog. 
The walls around you are stone-layered and sealed close almost squishing
you.  The only form of light provided in here is the gray skies high high
above you where a hole in the cavern is seen about 50 feet up.  A small
shaft lies in the southwestern corner of the room with a dangling rope
tightly hanging on a huge steel ring sealed to the floor.  This provides the
only exit other than the locked door to your south.

as the stone walls begin to cave in closer to disallow much space in
fighting.  Several black rats scurry across the abyss behind you.  A spark
of fire lights up on the upper left and right of you as a huge black gate
leading into the north shoots a bright light almost blinding you.  Several
cloaked guards stand behind these gates as you wonder where in the world you
are.

A Lair~
The lair turns suddenly cold as you notice a strange ray of light come
from up above where you came from.  As you scan around the darkness, you
realize that your voice carries across the dungeon as if the room goes on
for miles and miles around you.  A small shaft allows you to descend down
into the mysterious unknown below.

Standing Atop Another Grate~
This seems like a good place for you to rest as this empty room allows
you to ease a bit from all that you've gone through.  Not much is special to
see in this room.  Several squeaking noises like bats are heard flying about
you in the darkness.  A steel-made grate of sort lies below allowing you to
descend once again.

A Lair~
Crusted rocks outline the walls around this deserted lair as a horrible
smell of burning flesh seems to odorize in here immensely making you almost
nauseated.  A warm sensation, like someone breathing in here suddenly makes
this room a bit humid as your curiousity suddenly makes you cautious of what
could be around you.  A small shaft is here to allow you to flee downward.

A Passage~
You walk along a dark passage leading north and south here.  An iron door
with two strange brown torches hang beside it to the north.  From a
distance, you make out a choice of directions to the south.
