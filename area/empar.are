The Base of a Mountain~
A path begins to emerge from the pure wilderness that is the top of this
ridge.  It leads North towards the slopes of a giant mountain.  The shrubs
and trees here are shriveled as a result of the extreme elevation, and the
air is much thinner, making every step much more laborious.

Road to Castle Empar~
As you continue along the path you notice the trees and brush slowly
becoming more immaculate and well groomed.  As you look around for any signs
of life, you see only the grass and trees.  You slowly come to realize there
are no animals or insects and the sounds of birds have all but dissapeared. 
This is strange, strange indeed.

The Portal to Castle Empar~

thousands of feet tall surround it on all sides, making it completely
inaccessible by normal means.  A portal rises from the ground at the end of
the path, it can only lead one place ...

through those walls is the dusty pipe from which you emerged.  The energy of
the Aeternal radiates throughout this place, his curse penetrating the very
fabric of the rooms.
