{4Before the City of Legends{x~
Before you stands a city older then the mountains themselves.  Its
once proud walls stand before you, crumbling in the prevading elements.
Far to the North stands a Dark Castle, Past it on the Horizon you 
see two, twin towers.  A Bright beam dances wildly between the Spires.
You turn your attention to the city before you, The buzzing of the 
market fills your ears.
