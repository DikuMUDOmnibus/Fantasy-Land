Chief's Living Quarters~
Though hardly sumptuous, this room is much more comfortably furnished than
any you have seen previously within the lair. In the center of the room is
a circular table of polished wood with four chairs set around it. On the
table there are three items apparently made of silver - a platter carrying
fruit, a crafe, and a goblet. In the southeast corner is an armchair which
has been crudely, but seemingly comfortably, upholstered. Exits lead to 
the north and south.

burners, both lit, while in the center is a candelabram with four lit
