at you from hidden places everywhere you look, but they seem to be able to
evade your glance each time.  It seems they will only be seen when they will

Walking through Faeriedale~
Explosions of color seem to happen everywhere you look.  Bright reds, yellows
and greens seem to be the more popular ones.  Faeries seem to peek at you from hidden
places everywhere you look, but they seem to be able to evade your glance each 
time.  It seems they will only be seen when they will allow themselves to be seen.

The Lair of the White faerie~
You have managed, through luck(?), to find the lair of the white faerie.  It
stands before you, glaring at you with its pale blue eyes.  All around, the
walls are coated with a thick layer of ice.  You slip several times before
gaining your balance enough to face the fearsome beast.  Will you fight it,
or flee?  "It is JUST a faerie."

All around treasure glimmers.  It appears that the faeries have been
collecting for quite some time.  There are little bits of everything
here, from broken swords, to the leg bone of a dracolich.  The main thing
that catches your eye is the large pile of gold resting all around the room.

Treasure Room~
All about you are the untold fortunes of many generations of families.
Nothing here seems to be touched by age, it is all in perfect condition.        
It has remained as it was many years ago when it was taken.  Although the       
faerie and the original families considered these items "treasure", you
manage to find little of value beside a pile of gold coins you can collect.

The End of the Hallway~
You have come to the end of the hallway.  As you enter the room,
you hear a slight rumbling coming from the eastern wall.  You look,
and see that the wall has opened to reveal a safe passage to the
beginning of the cavern.  There is also an exit to the north.

An Ancient Path through the dense forest~
This path appears to be very old, and well travelled.  Funny, tho...
it is oddly quiet.  Huge trees almost block out the sun, yet the path
is obvious to the eye, no matter the time of day.

There is nothing else to look at but the mountain...it totally eclipses

The mountain face is actually pretty steep, and it is easy to lose one's
footing.  There are hand grips, but as they were made for the faeries, it's
impossible to fit any part of your body in them.

You have reached a small ledge about one fourth of the way up the mountain.
To the east is the entrance to what seems to be a small cave.  The sounds
of music and revelry come from it.

The cave is very colorful and music and laughter emanate from it.  It
seems as if this is the place where people gather to party.  At the moment,
however, there aren't many people around.  It turns out all the noise 
you heard is being piped in from somewhere else in the mountain.
