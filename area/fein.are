The corrupted messenger {cM{Ce{Wr{cc{Cu{Wr{cy{x sits here.

priority over his duties, and as a result, he never delivered an important
message.  He was then severed from godly connections, and now spends his
eternal life trapped in this accursed realm.

The door hangs on its last hinge waiting for a light breeze to knock it
down.  A small lamp is lit in the corner besides an old cot.  Along the wall
there are pictures of an odd looking man with torn clothing but a glistening
blade.  There is cobwebs and filth everywhere meaning this person has
probably been gone for awhile.

Hot, heavy steam bellows from the entrance, so visibility is very

distance most likely creating his next insane masterpiece.
