only maintain the guild proper, but also to open new markets in foreign
lands. The guild masters command much respect, wealth, and power throughout
the world. Guild matters are decided by a vote, scaled by the wealth of
each master. The 5 richest masters make up the council of 5, and argue on
the guilds behalf in contractual negotiations in town meetings. It has been
said that the council of 5 collectively owns one quarter of the world's

the guild holds its meetings. Votes in the guild are based weighted by

In The Secret Cave of the 6th Pirate Lord~
You have boldly entered the secret cave of the 6th pirate lord. About
you the evidence of his terrible crimes abounds. Here is a pilfered

lords. There is a cargo list of several missing merchant vessels. On the
desk is a scroll of the departure time, vessel name, and destination of
a rich noble. Yes you have discovered the kingpin of the pirate lords,
the man who has terrorized commerce for a decade. What will you do about 
it?
