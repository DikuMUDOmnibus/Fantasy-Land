Dirt Path~
You are standing on the middle of a dirt path.  Tall grass sways in the
breeze on either side of you.  The path itself seems well constructed,
though it has not seen maintenance in many years.  Nearby to the north, you
see a large mountain thrusting towards the sky.  The path leads in that
direction.  A small plaque seems to have been affixed to a nearby rock.

plaque~
This area created Feb.  2001 by Gynix, originally for Redemption mud.  It is
meant for levels 101-151, though there only one mob below level 180.  Be
careful, and play nice.

#63301
Base of the Mountain~
The path ends here, at the face of the mountain.  It appears that some
race carved what appears to be a doorway out of the face of the mountain. 
All along the edges of the doorway, intricate designs have been traced out. 
They appear unmarked by the passage of time.  Beyond the doorway, you see
what appears to be a serene field, covered in the long grass that surrounds
this mountain.  The field seems to shimmer at time, waving in a manner quite
similar to that of the grass.  The dirt path leads south, away from the
mountain.  The doorway is to the north.

The Field~
The grass is sparse here, growing thinner as it nears the blackened walls
to the south and west of you.  From time to time, you hear strange sounds
cutting through the air.  Everything is otherwise silent.  The only exits
from here are to the north and the east.

The Doorway~
You are standing on the southern side of a large field.  To your south, a
dark wall rises towards the blue sky.  Carved into the face of the wall is a
doorway, much like the one you saw on the other side.  Far to the east,
west, and north, you see similar walls.  The face of the wall is rough, and
the smell of something burning fills the air.  Around you, waist-high grass
waves gently in the breeze, casting a serene feel on things.  The portal in
the wall lies to your south.  In the other three directions lies the field.

The Field~
The ground ground grows rocky here, though not impassible.  Grass grows
in patches here and there, and its growth seems stunted.  The high, dark
walls block further passage to the east and the south.  Rocky paths lead
north and west, where the grass seems to be thicker.

This appears to be the western side of the field.  The grass has thinned
out considerably here, allowing for easier passage.  Set into the face of
the western wall is the portal of some kind.  It is difficult to see through
the portal, but you catch glimpses of sparkles, and flashes of light. 
Scattered at the base of the portal are shards of glass.  The field streches
off to the east, south, and north.

Center of the Field~
You are standing in the middle of a wide open field of tall grasses. 
Overhead, the blue sky stretches from horizon to horizon.  A warm breeze can
be felt, moving the grass with a soft rustling sound.  In the center of this
area is a small clearing.  In the middle of the clearing lies a large stone
block made of a rough black material.  The top of the block is stained by a
reddish substance that looks suspiciously like blood.  Scattered around the
block are large quantities of bones.  Some appear to be human, others appear
to be the bones of animals.

The Field~
You are standing on the eastern side of the large field.  Wide open
spaces lie in all directions but east.  To the east, a large wall lies,
blocking progress in that direction.  Set into the face of the wall is a
large portal.  Through the portal, you see what seems to be a bleak
wasteland, framed by a reddish sky.

The Field~
The western wall meets with the northern wall here, making a sharp
corner.  The rought surface of the wall is unyielding, and warm to the
touch.  The air smells as though something were on fire, yet you do not see
any smoke.  The breeze blowing through here is pleasantly warm.  The rest of
the field is off to the east and the south.

A Notch in the Wall~
The northern wall is broken here.  The ragged edges of the wall frame a
notch in which a downward sloping path can be seen.  The darkness that
swallows that path makes it difficult to make out what lies beyond.  The
field of grass continues to the west, south, and east.

The Field~
The ground is damp here, but does not completely dissolve into swampy
land.  Nourished by the dampness, the grass grows thick and heavy here,
threatening to impede travel.  Further travel to the north and the east is
blocked by large, blackish walls.  However, travel should still be possible
to the west and the south.

The Path of Glass~
You are standing in the middle of a rather unusual tunnel.  The walls are
composed of the same dark material that you saw in the field.  However, the
walls have been covered with variously-sized pieces of glass.  It crunches
under your feet and threatens to slice through your boots.  Light is
reflected off of the pieces of glass, creating a sparkling kalidoscope of
colors.  While pretty, it does hurt your eyes a little.  The tunnel leads
off to the west, while it ends to your east.  On the eastern wall,
surrounded by the glass, is a portal, beyond which you can see a grassy
field.

Only panes of solid glass prevent you from falling into the inky void on the
other side of the glass.  The glass tunnel leads west, while a rockier
tunnel lies to the east.

This room, usually kept dark, is large, and round in shape.  Pieces of
glass have been jammed into the rough surface of the wall, making the wall
even sharper than before.  On the floor many shards of broken glass lay
scattered, making it difficult to walk.  A few pieces of furniture, made
from crystal, have been placed in the room.  They seem to be surprisingly
heavy, not to mention difficult to move.  The only exit from this room is to

The land here is dark and bleak.  As far as the eye can see lies the
shattered ruins of what was once a large city.  Crumbled buildings litter
the grounds, making progress impossible, except for a path carved out to the
east.  To your west, a portal floats in midair.  Beyond that portal appears
to be a grassy field.  The sky overhead is red, as though something were on
fire, though you do not smell smoke.

Once this was the cobblestone street of a city.  Now, it is a path of
horror.  The reddish sky overhead casts a gloomy pallor over the area. 
Ruined buildings lie crumpled, some on their sides like toys dropped by a
careless child.  On the sides of some of these building, bodies hang,
impaled by large poles.  Parts of the street are covered in blood. 
Surprisingly, the path has been cleared in some places, allow progress to
the west and to the east.

despite the desolation that surrounds it.  A terrible stench fills the air. 
It reminds you of burnt flesh.  Occasionally, a scream fills the air.  The
building to your east appears dark.

A Graveyard~
A gloomy graveyard surrounds you.  Tombstones and grave markers of all
kinds jut upward from the ground, marking the location of long-deceased
people.  The ground is covered in a sickly yellow grass.  At the edges of
the cemetary, a wrought-iron fence keeps trespassers out.  Or perhaps it
keeps other things in.  The entrance to the graveyard is to your east. 
Instead of an iron gate, as you might expect, there is a door-shaped portal,
leading into darkness.  The only other exit is deeper into the graveyard to
your west.

swirls around, making it difficult to see.  The path consists of thin strip,
stetching west to east, where the grass finally gave up trying to grow.  In
the distance to your west, you can make out a small structure of some kind.

peering down at you with unconcealed malice.  The path stops directly at the
dark entrance to the crypt.  The only other exit is to your east.

eyeballs, in various stages of decay.  They seem to look at you without
expression.  It is almost as if these eyes are following your every move.

on the horizon, casting a reddish pallor over the area.  Oddly enough, the
sun does not appear be moving, as if this area was in a perpetual state of
sunset.  Flying around the room are fireflies, blinking at random intervals.
On the western wall a portal floats, leading to a stone hallway.  To the

Temple Alcove~
You are standing in an empty alcove.  The room has been kept clean,
though it appears to not have seen use for some time.  The walls here seem
very rough, as though the room has not been finished yet.  The only exit is
north.

The Rooftop of the Ashen Castle~
You are standing on the wide roof of the castle.  A circular steel
staircase leads down into the castle itself, which a large building is
visible to your north.  The warm winds are stronger up here, though not
strong enough to be dangerous.  Far to your south, you see a squarish
grass-filled field.  To your east, a small circle of stones can be seen.

The Throne Room of Ashfall~
You have entered a large throne room.  Lit torches, attached to the
walls, provide quite sufficient amounts of light.  The throne is made of the
same material as the walls, ceiling, and floor of the castle.  On either
side of the throne, large golden sculptures of demons can been seen.  On the
first, the word "Nightfall" can be read.  On the other, "Ashfall".  The only
exit from this room is south.

The Circle~
You are surrounded by large blocks about six feet high that form a circle
here.  To your west, you see the rest of the castle roof.  The air seems to
shimmer here, and you feel a great magical power.  Surprisingly, the smell
of ash is gone.
