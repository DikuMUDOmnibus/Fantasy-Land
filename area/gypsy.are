The Path to the Gypsy Camp~
The grass is matted down from all the traffic heading in and out of the
gypsy encampment.  The tracks lead south towards the camp.  In the distance,
are colorful covered wagons.  The sound of laughter and music emanates from
the camp.

The path continues~
The path is fairly well travelled for not being an official road.  It
seems that the gypsies have been camped here for quite some time, which
seems odd, as gypsies tend to move about a lot.  The way east and west are
blocked off by a dense forest.

The beginning of the camp~
Wagons align the side of the path and seem to virtually explode into a
myriad of colors: blues, reds, yellows, and all possible shades cover the
wagons.  The colors normally would clash, but here, at the gypsy camp, they
come together quite nicely.

This colorful wagon is the tonic wagon.  Pictures from all over the

Further into the Gypsy Camp~
The camp is starting look more organized.  The wagons that align the path
are here for the purpose of drawing in potential customers and to provide a
respite for the weary gypsies who need a break from all the festivities. 
Further to the south is a large open field where people are dancing wildly
to the entrancing music.

A covered wagon~
This is the wagon of the bone thrower.  Whereas the fortune teller is a
popular stop, because of her colorful turns of phrases and seemingly
true-to-word fortunes, the bone throwers wagon is visited mainly by people
who are in throes of desperation: a loved one is dying, they have lost their
home...  Situations like that.  The wagon is perhaps the most somber of them
all, with only a plain gray cover.

The Festival Tent~
In this room, people are resting their weary feet from the frantic
dancing of the festival grounds.  They are also refreshing themselves with
some gypsy concoted drink and food.  Who knows how safe that is; but their
thirst and hunger is great after all that dancing that they will eat just
about anything.  The festival grounds end here.

The True Gypsy Encampment~
The squalor and poverty of this area overwhelms.  It is nothing like the
camp ground the gypsies allow people to see.  Here crying children are left
untended while their parents desperately try to get more money to feed them.
The tents are covered in holes and vermin scurry across the fields.

A gypsy tent~
The tent can barely be called one.  Some of the holes are bigger than the
tent flap itself.  A small fire does little to keep the warmth inside the
tent, but the blankets on the bed have been well made and stacked upon each
other to cover any holes in them.

The Entrance to the Training Grounds~
Here is where the gypsies train in all skills.  From acrobatics to dagger
lunges, all is taught here.  Older gypsy men pass down their knowledge to
the younger generation, teaching them the ways of enchantment and prowess. 
training fields continue to the south, east and west, while the Gypsy
camp lies back to the north.

The Training Grounds~
The training grounds are busy day and night.  Gypsies work hard to learn
and keep their traditions alive, and they also work hard to be able to
protect their fellow gypsies, as they are raided often.  Training of all

self-defense.

On the River~
Gypsy children have left signs of their presence on the rocks jutting out

and toy animals.  Faded out clothes are laid to dry on the bigger rocks. 
The river flows by being carressed by the warm breeze.

The Wagon of the Gypsy Leader~
This is perhaps the most valued wagon of them all for within it is all of
the treasure of this Gypsy troup.  Only the leader knows of the treasure's
location and it is so well hidden that all the raids upon the camp have been
unsuccessful in unearthing the treasure.  The wagon is the most opulently
furnished of them all as the leader seems to be quite a greedy man
prospering while his people starve.
