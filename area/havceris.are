The Haven~
The wall that surrounds the haven is constructed of heavy stone.  It was
painstakingly constructed by the best craftsmen of the realm.  The gate to
the north is constructed of heavy, rough hewn wood.  From looking at the sky
a storm seems to be brewing.  The shelter the haven offers would be more
than welcome now.

the haven from the threat of invasion.  The entrance to the haven lies to
the east.

A path leads through the dark forest.  Leaves rustle in the ever

bolt of lightening strikes the ground only feet away.  The path
continues to the east and west.  A strange dark shadow of trees
disappear to the north where sudden darkness lies beyond.  A faint
trail out of this little pathway is visible to the south.
