Entrance to the Shadow Grove~
Before you, the grove of shadows lies. Giant grey trees are all that
can be seen through the thick shadows. A great sense of both power and
menace permeates the surrounding area. You have a strange urge to turn
back and go back the way you've come.
  A small path leads north into the shadows and back south to the road.

  A huge black cauldron is in the center of the room, bubbling and gurgling,
it pours forth a constant stream of smokey fog into the air about you. Here
and there on stands of different sizes are crystal balls and oddly shaped
mirrors.
