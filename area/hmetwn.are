Central Fountain~
Water spirts out from the mouth of a marble statue of the legendary
knight Rzata sitting on the top platform.  A warm blue imbues the
water in the lower basin.  Vines and moss enrobe the ledge of the
base of the fountain that provides seating.  A loud metal clanking
noise can be heard to the east nearby.  The smell of fresh pastry
blows in from the west occasionally.  A large variety of pleasant
chirps and twirps can be heard as a multitude of birds fly about.
