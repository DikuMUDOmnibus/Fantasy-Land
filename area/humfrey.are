gorgon~
The Gorgon~
The Gorgon is here, cleaning the castle and decorating.
~
The Gorgon is the wife of the Good Magician Humfrey.  Being of a good
heart and never wanting to hurt anyone, she was totally unaware that her
gaze was turning men into stone.  The Good Magician gave her a facial
invisibility potion to help her hide her petrifying looks, but the potion
wore off in the great Time of No Magic.  She instead went to Mundania, where
she worked in exotic bars, until coming back to Xanth to ask Humfrey if he
would marry her.  After her one year waiting period-fee, where Humfrey
allowed her to see his grumpy side, he said yes, and they were married.  The
Gorgon now wears dark glasses to hide her stare.  She is a remarkably able
and attractively voluptous woman with small snakes for hair and a very
pleasant way about her.

The manticora is a large beast with the face of a man, body of a lion,
wings of a dragon, and the tail of a scorpion.  It is the size of a horse
and is one of the most savage creatures in Xanth.  It is serving its year
term with the Good Magician Humphrey, and is not endangering anyone of

Hugo~
Hugo is here, conjuring some rotten fruit.
~
Hugo is the son of Humfrey and the Gorgon.  Rather slow and dull-witted,
he is a major disappointment to his father.  The Gorgon, however, continues
to lavish love upon her only son, and even Humfrey has tried to help him
improve his rather useless talent of conjuring rotten fruit.

magician good humfrey~
The Good Magician Humfrey~
The Good Magician Humfrey is here, studying a book.
~
The Good Magician Humfrey is an irritable old man with a short temper an
incredible amount of knowledge.  He is not "good" in the sense of the word,
yet cares about the welfare of Xanth.  He charges a year service in advance
for his answers to your question and does not like to be bothered with
trifles.  Humfrey is a smallish man who looks rather like an old gnome. 
Being close to a thousand years old, he uses drops of water from the
Fountain of Youth to stay young.  With is gnarled big feet and large nose,
you cannot understand why a beautiful woman like the Gorgon would want to
marry him.

The Stone Wall~
You are standing before a long stone wall inside the Good Magician
Humfrey's Castle.  You can see no way to pass this massive wall of stone,
and looking east and west, you can observe that it stretches out
indeterminally.  This is the second challenge to gain an audience with the
Good Magician.

You have a secret passageway underneath the castle.  This small and
narrow passage leads under the stone wall, effectively bypassing the second
challenge to meet the Good Magician Humfrey.  The crawlspace is dark and
smells musty, as if it has not been used in ages.  A faint light can be seen
to the south, and filled with hope, you crawl towards it.

wines sit here aging, and the bittersweet smell of oak caskets fill the air.
The basement extends south.  Finding your way out of this large basement

Humfrey's Study~
You are inside a HUGE room cluttered with all sorts of objects.  A large
desk sits next to the window cut into the north wall.  Books and rare tomes
litter the desk and stacks of potions and scroll sit in a basket in the
corner of the room.  A large mirror is hung upon the west wall and the very
floor is buried under strange objects you have never seen before.  This must
be Humfrey's study.

Humfrey's Vault~
You are inside Humfrey's vault.  There are a number of potions, scroll,
and other assorted magical objects stacked upon the shelves here.  These
must be very powerful items, judging by the thickness of the vault door.

The Brink~
You have reached the top southern brink of the Gap Chasm.  The view of
the chasm from here is breathtaking although the sheer heights you are at
makes you feel a tad bit woozy.  To the south lies the way to the Good
Magician Humphrey's castle, and the way into the Gap Chasm lies to the
north.

Outside The Good Magician Humfrey's Castle~
You are standing outside the Good Magician Humfrey's castle.  The castle
is a large grand edifice made from stone and a circular moat surrounds the
entire castle.  The building looks rather imposing and you notice that the
drawbridge is up, stopping you from crossing over.  This must be the first
of the three challenges you must pass in order to meet the magician.

The Edge of the Moat~
You are standing before the moat.  The water is rather fetid and filled
with a greenish slime and you see something moving inside.  Small blackish
plants grow at the edge of the water, and you can see no plausible way to
pass through to the other side.

The Middle of the Moat~
You have wandered inside the moat surrounding the castle.  The water you
are wading through is slimy and clings to you, much to your disgust.  To the
south you can see the entrance into the castle, barred by a large
drawbridge.  As you search about for the key to let the drawbridge, you can
sense something under the water approaching you.

Inside the Good Magician Humfrey's Castle~
You have passed the first challenge to meet to Good Magician Humfrey. 
However two still remain.  In front of you lies a large stone wall.  You
have no idea what it is doing here, yet it bars any entrance into the
castle.  The stone wall stretches far to the east and west, and you rack
your brains trying to figure out the puzzle of how to get through the wall.
