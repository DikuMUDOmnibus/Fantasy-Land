The shrieking winds of a monstrous storm surround you, spinning you around
in an endless web of fury. But then, in the middle of turmoil, you find a
strange calm. You find yourself hovering in the calm eye of a hurricane. All
around you you can see the desruction caused by the powerful storm. White
hot flashes of lightning flicker from the depths of the hurricane.  But
everything is strangely peaceful in here, with the sun shining in from above
and a flock of birds winging across the sky.  You stretch out and relax, this
storm is going to be here a while.

studded with a thousand gleaming jewels.  Below you hangs the beautiful
fields of Earth, looking fragile and far away, but full of hope.  A sense of
wistful regret touches you, as you think about what might have been, and what
will be.

The Satin Memorial Reading Room~
Half read books lie everywhere: Yeats, Tennyson, Chandler, Barrie;
a battered paperback de Laclos; a dusty leather-bound Donne.  A
damp novel perches precariously on the edge of a large bathtub.
As your eyes travel beyond the steam rising to the air toward the
rose-brambled balcony railing, you notice a well-creased printout
of a poem sitting on a the velvet cushions of a rosewood chair
that has been set so as to see the stark black mountains
from one angle, or the wine-dark sea from another.

The ocean is constantly smashing up against the cliffs and rending
huge slabs from it.  The beach is scarcely a beach at all, more a

down, it filters through the spaces and makes an unnerving rattling
sound.

The page it is flipped open to reads:

A sudden blow: the great wings beating still
Above the staggering girl, her thighs carressed
By the dark webs, her nape caught in his bill,
he holds her helpless breast upon his breast.
How can those terrified vague fingers push
The feathered glory from her loosening thighs?
And how can body, laid in that white rush,
But feel that strange heart beating where it lies?
A shudder in the loins engenders there
The broken wall, the burning roof and tower
And Agammemnon dead.  Being so caught up,
So mastered by this brute blood of the air,
Did she put on his knowledge with his power
Before his indifferent beak could let her drop?

A copy of Peter Pan is opened near the end:

What sort of form was Hook showing?  Misguided man though he
was, we may be glad, without sympathising with him, that in
the end he stayed true to the traditions of his race.  The
other boys were flying about him now, flouting, scornful; and
as he staggered about the deck striking at them impotently, his
mind was no longer with them; it was slouching in the playing
fields of long ago, or being sent up for good, or watching
the wall-game from a famous wall.  And his shoes were right,
and his waistcoat was right, and his tie was right, and his
socks were right.

James Hook, thou not wholly unheroic figure, farewell.

         Old age hath yet his honour and the toil
         Death closes all; but something ere the end,
         Some work of noble note, may yet be done,
         Not unbecoming of men that strove with the gods.

.       'One is very soon bored of everything, my angel; it is a law
        of nature.  It is not my fault.
        If, that is to say, that I am bored with an adventure that has
        claimed my attentions for four mortal months, it is not my fault.
        If, that is to say, my love is equal to your virtue - and that
        is certainly saying a great deal - it is not surprising that
        one should come to the end at the same time as the other.  It
        is not my fault.
        A woman that I love madly now insists that I give you up for
        her.  It is not my fault.
        I quite realize that this is the perfect opportunity to accuse
        me of perjury: but if, where nature has gifted men with no
        more than constancy, she has given women obstinacy, it is
        not my fault.
        Believe this, you should take another lover, even as I take
        another mistress.  This is good, very good advice: if you
        find it bad, it is not my fault.
        Good-bye, my angel.  I took you with pleasure, I leave you
        without regret.  I shall come back perhaps.  Such is life.
        It is not my fault.

A Sea Cave~
You are in a small cave in a cliff next to a deep green sea.  Fine
gold and pink sand blanket the floor.  Shells are scattered and strewn
about.  A blow hole in the roof of the cave allows beams of light to stream
in and illuminate the cave.  The wind blows outside the entrance, but
you are protected from the weather in your cozy cave.  The foamy surf
never seems to quite reach your feet.  Several boulders here have been
worn by time into a shape similar to a comfortable chair.

The scene lain before you is one that gives you the feeling of being placed

hillside where many aged crosses still stand.  The Arena is set in a wide
pit-like field of trampled bloodstained grass, and is guarded by high walls
of veinous marble.  A bloodstone seat awaits the true paragon of Romanity.

You have reached the end of the halls of Valhalla.  There are heavy doors
on 3 walls.  They lead into the rooms of the gods.  The hall goes back to
the west, and there is some sort of an exit above you.  Torches sputter
softly and the scent of incense is strong here.

You are on the Rainbow Bridge leading up to the Realm of {YA{Wl{wt{Wo{Yn{x. Clouds and
mist swirl around your feet. The view from here is incredible. It is little
wonder that Alton, God of Neutrality, claims this as his domain.

Eriana's Grove~
You have stumbled into a peaceful, fragrant grove surrounded by deep forest,
and carpeted in thick, lush grass. A waterfall cascades from a rock ledge to
the north, and empties into a quiet pool in which many rainbow-colored fish
feed.  Next to the pool a massive weeping willow trails its long, sinuous
fingers in the water. Large iridescent-blue fruit hang heavily from a
silver-barked tree nestled in boulders. Sunlight streams through the thick
anopy of trees, spilling across the low, comfortable grass hassocks scattered
about.  Exotic flowers of all shapes and sizes color the grove and send rich
perfume wafting throughout, while many-colored butterflies dance among them.
A variety of wide-eyed rabbits, deer, and other creatures move about, watching
you inquisitively, yet unafraid.

    At the far end of the grove is a large, oddly-grown tree trunk.
    You notice a banner suspended in the air as if by magic.
