The warmth of the newly risen sun awakens you from your slumber.  You
struggle to become fully awake, ready to greet another spectacular day. 
Struggling to your feet, your body stiff from the chill of the night air,
you take a second to stretch before packing up your supplies and heading
out.  Who knows what discoveries this new day will bring?

vision in your dreams.  It is a vision of an artifact, buried long ago by
the shifting sands of a vast desert some time ago.  You know not why you
must search for it, only that you must.

All around you is darkness.  A darkness so complete that your light
barely manages to throw enough illumination to see more than a few steps
ahead of you.  The silence is deafening, nothing moves in here, at least
nothing that makes a sound as it moves.  The very thought that a creature
could move up silently behind you raises gooseflesh on your skin.  As you
move your lightsource around in a circle, you realize that all directions
look the same, no choice looks any better or worse than any other.

Another step into the forest reveals only more of the same.  Trees so
impossibly huge they block out the sun, not one ray of light manages to
penetrate the darkness.  You feel your way almost blindly forward, your hand
landing on the rough bark of the tree ahead of you.  A shadow quickly moves
past you in the darkness, barely visible in the dim light.  What was that?! 
You feel a sudden urge to run..  Only to find that there is no way out.

yourself, trying to calm down.  You envision the artifact which draws you on
this journey, and a sudden peace comes over you.  Yet once again, swinging
your light source in an arc around you, you can find no trail to follow,
only darkness, and the ever present feeling that someone, or someTHING is
watching you, luring you deeper into this maze of blackness.

Darkness and nothing but more darkness.  Another step and suddenly you're
ankle deep in some sort of goo, the thought of it makes your skin crawl. 
After several minutes of squirming and twisting, you find yourself unable to
free yourself of it's grasp.  Steeling yourself, you lower your light toward
your feet, and gasp in disbelief at what you see.  Black as pitch, as
sickeningly pungent as raw sulfur, a creature rises from the darkness.  It
has no distinct form, but is somewhat humanlike for it's hand is what is
holding you firmly to this spot.  Bile rises in your throat, blood rushes
from your face as the creature pulls itself to its' full height before you.

practically knocking yourself unconscious.  Your heart pounds in your chest,
the fear of the unknown becoming almost overwhelming.  Even concentrating on
the object of your journey fails to bring you any inner peace now.  A
solitary tear falls unbidden from the corner of your eye, as you begin to
think you will never escape the darkness.

just how dangerous a mistake that may have been...  Something is definitely
moving toward you.

you've also lost your front teeth.  Suddenly you're gripped by a fit of
laughter, a defense mechanism against the fear which has begun to suffocate
your very being.  Rolling over onto your back, you reach for your light,
unable to see if you've done any other damage to yourself.  Bringing it
closer, you inspect your body, all else seems well.  Again that eerie
feeling of being watched begins to come over you, and you decide to hurry
along.

Shining your light into the opening it seems empty, and the perfect place to
rest your aching lungs.  You squeeze yourself into the tree feet first, and
snuff out your lightsource, hoping that while you're hidden in this old
tree, you'll be safe.  Several minutes pass, and you begin to relax.  You
close your eyes, anxious to block out the visions of horror you've seen. 
And suddenly...  You realize something is terribly wrong.  Some unseen force
is tightening around your legs.  But that can't be!

fighting that awful creation.  The pain is nearly unbearable, and you swing
your light so as to examine the damage.  As expected, the break is a nasty
one, a horrible compound fracture that has left two piece of white bone
protruding through your skin.  Your spirit nearly broken, you seriously
doubt your ability to finish the journey you've undertaken.

been wandering for what seems like hours now, and still haven't found your
way out.  At each turn the forest seems to close in around you, shadows
coalesce into forms, forms into horrible enemies.  You search in vain with
your light to see if you can find a way out, but to no avail.  You decide to
try a few more steps, perhaps you will get lucky.

Although you can't be sure, it appears to smile menacingly at you, then
without warning attacks!

straps holding the makeshift splint in place, preventing your leg from
moving.  Looking around you notice an almost invisible shaft of light
nearby, could it be the way out?!  Your heart races at the prospect, your
soul sings with joy.  Feeling a renewed sense of purpose, you stride
painfully toward it, hoping against all hope that it is indeed the end of
this horrible place.

The caves are said to be of a rock which prevents all methods of location. 
Once inside, you will literally be without your senses.  Anyone, or anyTHING
might sneak up on you, and you would not see them until it was too late.

Something calls you deeper into the caves, the darkness is suffocating. 
If it weren't for your lightsource, you would surely be completely lost. 
Sliding your hand over the surface of the rock, you are reminded of
highly-polished glass.  The symmetry of the caverns leads you to believe
they may have been manmade.  There seems to be a passage to the east and
north, which will you choose?

other tunnel.  Not impossible, you decide, but surely it would be easier to
continue on this level.  That leaves a decision to be made, will it be the
eastern path, or perhaps another descent?

revealing it's true form, only further fueling your fear.  Horribly large,
pointed teeth are all you can see, the rest of the creature, save for it's
glowing yellow eyes, is hidden by the darkness.  It lashes out at you, claws
tearing into your flesh.  Your fight or flight instinct takes over, and you

Curious, you run your hands along the wall just in front of you, only to be
repulsed by what you feel.  It feels almost like wool or some other course

Inky darkness surrounds you, swallowing what little light your torch
throws.  A faint breeze cools your skin, making the flame of your torch
flicker.  At least you won't completely suffocate, you think to yourself. 
Just above the cave floor is a ledge, and you decide to pull yourself up to
see what's up there.

Clawing your way up to the ledge, you manage to get to your feet. 
Holding your light in front of you, you walk a few steps before freezing in
your tracks.  What looks back at you is something fearsome, although you
cannot see its' entire form, just its' bright green eyes!  It bellows
loudly...  Was that a warning or a cry of attack?  It's impossible to tell,
and your feet seem frozen to the very ground you stand on.

Sahrin'Tar, literally translated, "The Lair of Horrors".  Somehow this
knowledge holds no comfort for you.  Just ahead there seems to be a ledge,
if you can just pull yourself up you could explore what's there...  Assuming
you really want to of course.

Barely half-way up onto the ledge, something powerful grips your arm and
pulls you easily the rest of the way.  Glancing up, you see a creature which
returns your surprised expression with one of its' own.  A small torch sits
in a crevice of the wall, giving off practically no light, but more than
your light alone.  The creature does not attack, indeed it seems to be
studying you.  In it's powerful grip is a rather large and dangerous looking
weapon.

You quickly turn, suddenly convinced you are being stalked.  As you stop
and listen, you hear nothing but your own heartbeat.  Still not convinced
you listen a bit longer, but hear nothing.  Deciding your fear is getting
the best of you, you press onward.  Perhaps what you search for is in this
very cave.  But deep down inside you know better than that, this is just the
beginning of your perilous adventure.

Yet another dropoff.  With the way your luck is going, it's a sure bet
something dangerous lies down below.  You swing your light down into the
darkness, but as expected, you can't see much at all, not even the floor of
the cavern below.  Not completely stupid, you take a small piece of rock and
toss it down.  It hits bottom only a few seconds after you drop it, a good
sign.  Deciding to take the chance, you carefully make your way down.

above the floor.  If it's another creature like the others, this one is even
larger.  There does appear to be a slight bit of light coming in from
somewhere beyond the "creature".  It seems it may be your way out, thing is,
do you want to take on another fight in your condition?

opening.  But first you'll have to get past this creature, who does not wait
for you to decide whether you'll attack or not, he takes the initiative. 
His weapon flashes brightly as it strikes, intense heat searing the wound
closed as it slices across your left shoulder.

you want nothing more than to escape it's suffocating grasp.

grown even more unbearable.  You can hardly keep your eyes open or take the
slightest of breaths because of it.  In the darkness just above you can see
two glowing orbs of green, yet another of those hideous beasts calls that
piece of cavern its' home.  You begin to struggle your way up the ledge,
knowing if you can defeat it, the treasure it may hold or guard will be well
worth the risk.

While parrying the blows of this ghastly creation, you manage to get a

little light there is here in subtle rainbows.  His weapon is also deadly
looking, although what you can see of it is just a blur as it whizzes
through the air.  Just above the creature, in the cavern ceiling, is a
slight opening, or what appears to be an opening, worth checking out if you
defeat this monster.

forcing you to shield your eyes, having spent time in the total darkness of
the nearby caves.  Looking off into the distance, you can see dozens upon
dozens of dead trees, standing amidst a flooded marshland.

Only a few steps into the swamp, and already you're soaked.  The water is
cold, and not very pleasant smelling either.  The swampfloor is thick mud,
pulling at your boots as you try to walk, and almost managing to pull them
free.  Almost thigh deep in the nasty water, you are forced to keep your
weapon above the surface, or risk ruining it.  Worse yet, it might not be
easily accessible in time of danger.  Nearby to the west, a large hollow
tree stands silently, beckoning you.

you quickly struggle to your feet.  So much for not getting your weapon wet.
When you fell your hand landed on something definitely not mud, it was
solid, no doubt about it.  With one free foot you search the water for
whatever it was, and come up with buried treasure.

to be no less horrific.  As it slowly rises from the water to stand

which appear suddenly as they have from the beginning of your trek are no
longer so formidable, at least in your minds' eye.  You fight them off with

What a fool you were, to think you'd escape the clutches of the swamp so
easily.  Seemingly from nowhere the apparition before you solidifies into
the form of a barbarian.  He stands several heads taller than you, and looks
far more dangerous than you could ever hope to.  Your instinct tells you to
leave, and find another way out, but you know deep down that it is a
fruitless option, as all ways most likely lead back here.  So stand and
fight you will, and do battle with the menacing foe before you.  Defeat him,
and the relative safety of the verdant hills just to the east will be yours.

sunlight.  It looks enticing as a place to rest, with large conifers ringing
the area, offering a safe haven from the sun.

Peaceful is the only word you can use to describe the lakeside.  The

has completely vanished.  Serenity has replaced it, and your body begs for
the chance to recover.  Foraging around, you gather together several dried
pine boughs, and pile them together before setting them afire.  The warmth
is welcomed, drying your clothes and soothing your muscles.  Settling down
beneath an enormous conifer, you rest in a pile of soft pine needles and
drift off.

little voice you hear implores you to explore it, despite the other little
voice which is warning you it is a dangerous place.  The war of the voices
inside your head ends abruptly, with the expected result.  Sighing heavily,
you begin to move forward, forward into that wasteland.

Shimmering in the heat of the sun just ahead, is what appears to be a vast
desert.  Nothing appears to inhabit it, but that little warning inside your

here, it looks like the last chance for water for some time.

It looks as if something big impacted the ground here, causing a large

lift, or continue around the rest of this level first, and see what other
treasures/horrors you may encounter?  The choice is yours, choose wisely.

You've reached another bend in the path, the area dimly lit by a
lightsource not far away.  Just to the south you can hear something moving
about in the darkness, you can only pray it is a friendly critter this time,
although you know damn well it won't be.  Will you summon your courage and
discover the source of those sounds?  Or chicken out and return to the
relative safety of the light not far away.

Total darkness.  Nothing visible whatsoever.  But those sounds are
nearby, perhaps within arms' reach now.  You reach out tentatively before
you in the darkness, hoping yet NOT hoping to find the source of those
sounds.  On the last swing of your arms, you come across something. 
Something cold...  Something.....  Alien.

Warily you continue your exploration of this strange new environment. 
Never before has anything like it been seen in these realms, and deep down
inside, you wish you'd never seen it either.  But it's too late for that
now, the voice continues to compel you forward, deeper into the darkness. 
There are faint scraping sounds just to the north, sending chills up and
down your spine...  But you must know what the sounds are, despite your
fear.  Summoning your courage, you step forward into the blackness.

Ytl's Chamber~
Poof!  You arrive in a flash of smoke and light, only to find yourself
being attacked by some strange creature.  As your vision clears, you get a
chance to glimpse the enemy before you.  It is massive, wearing nothing but
a weapon, some sort of tattoo, and a nasty grin.  It looks nothing like the
other creatures you've seen thus far, and you wonder while parrying his
blows whether or not he is the most dangerous of them all.

The light quickly fades as you emerge from it, leaving you standing in a
cold, sterile room.  Scanning your surroundings, you are pleased to see no
creatures nearby, and can hear no sounds of them in the distance either. 
This level seems to be rather well-lit, the source of the light seeming to
come from all around you.  It reflects off the metallic surfaces, and
although not nearly as bright as the light you first encountered, it is
bright nonetheless, making you occasionally squint as you look about.

Proceeding cautiously, you realize no matter how quiet you try to be your
footfalls echo loudly.  The corridor takes a turn here, leading to new and
undiscovered territory.  You've so far managed to evade the guards on duty,
but you somehow know more encounters are inevitable.  Your hand moves
unbidden to your side, checking your pack to be sure you're properly
prepared for what lies ahead.  Suddenly you hear movement nearby, and decide
it would be best to move on.

Not far in the distance in either direction, there appear to be
passageways leading up.  You hesitate, your instincts telling you not to
push your luck, that inner voice urging you onward.  Silently you wish this
were but a nightmare, that you could simply wake up soon and you'd be safe
at home.  A smirk crosses your face as you realize the lunacy in that
thought.  Your encounters so far have left tangible reminders of their
reality.  No, this is not an unbidden dream in the night...  It is your
worst nightmare come true.

you to stay put, that damned inner voice insists you explore the upper
reaches of this place.  Beads of sweat form on your forehead as you
contemplate what to do.  Once again you are helpless to deny the voice, and
know what you must do...

Sounds can be heard in the distance, a gentle whirring noise, but try as you
might, you cannot detect where it is coming from.  Again you have the uneasy
feeling of being watched, but at the same time are driven further into this

sounds from somewhere above you, but no way up can be found.  With each step
you can hear that voice inside your head urging you onward, to explore the
unknown.  Cautiously, you press onward.

Walking along, your eyes continually scan in all directions.  As you
glance upwards, you notice what appears to be an opening above you.  Several
seconds pass, with no immediate danger to be found, and you begin to
consider making your way up somehow.  There is a small plaque on the wall
here, although inscribed with those strange symbols you first encountered
when you stumbled upon the metallic object in the sand, again you are able
to comprehend it's written message clearly.

Gazing upon the plaque, that inner voice quickly translates the message
written on it.  "Vlyxnylx is an ardent fan of free trade, he judges no one
by race or class, except for an inherent distaste for anyone below the level
of hero.  His store is comprised of many items of interest to those who have
proven themselves worthy of the highest mortal title in the land, and he
willingly trades them for your shiny coinage."

Oh, no.  You've gone and done it now.  Went and made the wrong decision. 
You've landed yourself face to face with the single most ugly creation
you've ever seen.  Eww..  And also the nastiest smelling as well.  You can
barely see your eyes are tearing so badly from the pungent aroma of this
beast.  What purpose it serves is beyond your ability to comprehend, it
certainly couldn't be a pet could it?

Climbing up cautiously, you emerge just behind an alien guard.  He
doesn't seem to notice you, perhaps you should just walk away before he
does.  He appears to be communicating with others of his kind, gesturing
with one long-fingered hand toward the distance.  Standing perfectly still,
you make your decision.  Will you take on the guard?  Or continue along your
journey?

Another silent step, and you come to the conclusion that this is

fro, checking for intruders.  Something highly valuable must be nearby, and
it occurs to you that perhaps this is what you have been searching for. 
Cautiously you continue onward...

you can hear faint sounds of footfalls pacing back and forth.  As your hand
brushes the surface of the door, it vibrates, and emits a soft amber glow. 
This is definitely where you must go to finish your journey.  Are you

complete here, and you quickly reach for your torch, illuminating a small
section.  Swinging your light in a circle around you, nothing seems unusual,
until that is, you move your torch so that you can better see the floor.  It
is then that you realize you are but millimeters away from a vast opening in
the floor.  Just beside you looks to be a small lift device, wonder where it

Something tells you that it would be important to take one, but there are so
many to choose from, it is difficult to know which one.  For once the little
voice isn't very specific, and you decide to simply take one of each just to
be sure.  As you begin to assemble your collection, you realize that one
stands out among the others.  Its' surface is lightly engraved, and upon
examing it closer, that voice begins to tell you that this is indeed the
one.

heavily in resignation, you wonder if this torture will ever end, it just
seems to get worse and worse.  Then again, at least nothing has attacked you
in this room, so perhaps you should count your blessings.  Groping around in
the dark, your hand touches some cloth, but your nightsight is not good
