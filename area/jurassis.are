Pteranodons were flying reptiles (pterosaurs) that were about 6 feet (1. 
8 m) long, had a 25 foot (7.  8 m) wingspread, and weighed about 35 pounds. 
This wing-span is longer than any known bird.  They had hollow bones, were
lightly built, had almost no tail, and small bodies.  They may have had fur.
They had large brains and good eyesight.  Some pteranodons had long,
light-weight, bony crests on their heads that may have acted as a rudder or
stabilizer when flying, or may have been a sexual characteristic.  They had
no teeth.

An apatosaurus is here.
~
Apatosaurus could have held its head at most 17 feet (5.  4 m) off the
ground (Parrish and Stevens,1999).  This afforded Apatosaurus protection
from predators, since most couldn't attach its head or neck, and probably
had more sense than to attack its gigantic, clawed feet or whip-like tail. 
Strangely, Apatosaurus' nostrils were located on the top of its head. 
Device for a water-dwelling animal, but this theory has been repudiated. 
Since Apatosaurus fossils have been found far from any water-dwelling
fossils, it is now believed that Apatosaurus spent most of its time on land,
far from large bodies of water or swamps.

Triceratops was a rhinoceros-like dinosaur.  It walked on four sturdy
legs and had three horns on its face along with a large bony plate
projecting from the back of its skull (a frill).  One short horn above its
parrot-like beak and two longer horns above its eyes probably provided
protection from predators, and were possibly used in mating rivalry and
rituals.  It had a large skull, up to 10 feet (3 m) long, one of the largest
skulls of any land animal ever discovered.  Its head was nearly one-third as
long as its body.  Triceratops hatched from eggs.  Triceratops was about 30
feet long (9 m), 10 feet tall (3 m), and weighed up to 6-12 tons.  It had a
short, pointed tail, a bulky body, column-like legs with hoof-like claws,
and a bony neck frill rimmed with bony bumps.  It had a parrot-like beak,
many cheek teeth, and powerful jaws.

Tyrannosaurus rex was a fierce predator that walked on two powerful legs
in Cretaceous period forests.  This meat-eater had a huge head with large,
pointed, replaceable teeth and well-developed jaw muscles.  It had tiny
arms, each with two fingers.  Each bird-like foot had three large toes, all
equipped with claws.  T.  Rex had a slim, stiff, pointed tail that provided
balance and allowed quick turns while running.  T.  Rex's neck was short and
muscular.  Its body was solidly built but its bones were hollow. 
Tyrannosaurus rex was up to 40 feet (12.  4 m) long, about 15 to 20 feet (4.
6 to 6 m) tall.  It was roughly 5 to 7 tons in weight.  T.  Rex left
footprints 1.  55 feet (46 cm) long (although its feet were much longer,
about 3.  3 feet (1 m) long, T.  Rex, like other dinosaurs walked on its
toes).

Allosaurus was a powerful predator that walked on two powerful legs, had
a strong, s- shaped neck, and had vertebrae that were different from those
of other dinosaurs (hence its name, the "different lizard").  It had a
massive tail, a bulky body, and heavy bones.  Its arms were short and had
three-fingered hands with sharp claws that were up to 6 inches (15 cm) long.
Allosaurus was up to 38 feet long (12 m) and 16.  5 feet tall (5 m).  It
weighed about 1400 kg.  It had a 3 feet long (90 cm) skull with two short
brow-horns and bony knobs and ridges above its eyes and on the top of the
head.  It had large, powerful jaws with long, sharp, serrated teeth 2 to 4
inches (5 to 10 cm) long.  The different species of Allosaurus varied in
weight.  Allosaurus fragilis, A.  Atrox, and A.  Ferox weighed about 1.  1
to 1.  9 tons (1 tonne to 1.  7 tonnes); A.  Amplexus was much heavier and
weighed about 2.  7 to 5.  5 tons (3 tonnes to 5 tonnes).  Allosaurus was
very common, and was the biggest meat-eater in North America during the late
Jurassic period.

Brachiosaurus was one of the tallest and largest dinosaurs yet found.  It
had a long neck, small head, and relatively short, thick tail.  It walked on
four legs and, like the other Brachiosaurids and unlike most dinosaurs, its
front legs were longer than its hind legs.  These unusual front legs
together with its very long neck gave Brachiosaurus a giraffe-like stance
and great height, up to 40-50 feet tall (12-16 m).  Brachiosaurus was about
85 feet long (26 m), and weighed about 50-80 tons.  Like other
Brachiosaurids, it had chisel-like teeth, its nostrils were on the top of
its head, and it had large nasal openings indicating that it may have had a
good sense of smell.  Brachiosaurus had 26 teeth on top jaw and 26 on the
bottom for a total of 52 teeth.  It had a claw on the first toe of each
front foot and claws on the first three toes of each rear foot (each foot
had five toes with fleshy pads).

Diplodocus was a long-necked, whip-tailed giant, measuring about 90 feet
(27 m) long with a 26 foot (8 m) long neck and a 45 foot (14 m) long tail,
but its head was less than 2 feet long.  It was among the longest land
animals ever.  Its nostrils were at at the top of its head and it had
peg-like teeth, but only in the front of the jaws.  Its front legs were
shorter than its back legs, and all had elephant-like, five-toed feet.  One
toe on each foot had a thumb claw, probably for protection It was more
lightly built than the other giant sauropods, and may have weighed only
about 10-20 tons.  Its backbone had extra bones underneath it, which had
bony protrusions running both forwards and backwards (anvil shaped), a
"double beam", probably for support and extra mobility of its neck and tail.
It may have used its whip-like tail for protection.

agile, bipedal (walked on two legs), bird-like dinosaur.  It had a curved,
flexible neck, and a big head with sharp, serrated teeth in very powerful
jaws.  The second toe on each foot had a 14 inch (35 cm) sickle-like claw
and the other toes had smaller claws.  When alive, this claw would have been
sheathed in a horny, keratinous material much like our fingernails, making
the claw even bigger, longer and sharper.  The long tail was used for
balance and fast turning ability.  It had a relatively large brain and
large, keen, eyes.  Megaraptor was about 20-26 feet (6-8 m) long.

Stegosaurus measured up to 26-30 feet long (8-9 m), about 9 feet tall (2.
75 m), and weighed about 6,800 pounds (3100 kg).  Its small brain was only
the size of a walnut (weighing roughly 2.  5 - 2.  9 ounces (70 - 80 grams).
Its skull was long and narrow; it had a toothless beak and small cheek
teeth.  Its head was carried close to the ground, probably no more than 3
feet (1 m) high.  Stegosaurus had 17 bony plates that were embedded in its
back.  Since they were not attached to its bones, no one is sure exactly how
they were positioned.  Also, the function of these plates is uncertain.  The
plates were made of bone which was not solid, but was filled with tube-like
tunnels.  The plates were prbobaly well- nourished by blood vessels,
indicating that the plates may have been used to regulate the dinosaur's
temperature.  They may have also been used for protection or mating display
purposes.  Stegosaurus also had tail spikes at the end of its flexible tail.
These spikes were up to four feet long and were used for protection from
predators.  Different species of Stegosaurus had different numbers of tail
spikes; Stegosaurus ungulatis had 8 spikes and Stegosaurus stenops had 4
spikes.  Stegosaurus' rear legs were longer and straighter than its front
legs, which sprawled out to the sides.  The forefeet (the feet of the front
legs) had five short, wide toes with short, hoof-like tips.  The rear feet
had three short, wide toes with hooves.

(as smart as a modern bird).  It was a theropod about 6 feet (1.  75 m) long
and may have weighed about 110 pounds (50 kg).  This light-weight dinosaur
had long hind legs and a stiff tail.  Trodon had large eyes and may have had
a good sense of hearning.  It had a large, sickle-shaped toe claw on its
second toe, and smaller ones on the other.  It had three long, clawed

Velociraptor may have been able to run up to roughly 40 mph (60 km/hr) for
short bursts.  Velociraptor was about 6 feet long (2 m), and 3 feet tall (1
m).  It may have weighed about 15 to 33 pounds (7 to 15 kg).  It had a stiff
tail that worked as a counterbalance and let it make very quick turns. 
Velociraptor brains were very large in comparison to their body size (this

Archaeopteryx (meaning "ancient wing") is a very early prehistoric bird,
dating from about 150 million years ago during the Jurassic period, when
many dinosaurs lived.  It is one of the oldest-known birds.  Archaeopteryx
seemed to be part bird and part dinosaur.  Unlike modern-day birds, it had
teeth, three claws on each wing, a flat sternum (breastbone), belly ribs
(gastralia), and a long, bony tail.  Like modern-day birds, it had feathers,
a lightly-built body with hollow bones, a wishbone (furcula) and reduced
fingers.  This crow-sized animal may have been able to fly, but not very far
and not very well.  Although it had feathers and could fly, it had
similarities to dinosaurs, including its teeth, skull, lack of horny bill,
and certain bone structures.  Archaeopteryx had a wingspan of about 1.  5
feet (0.  5 m) and was about 1 foot ( 30 cm) long from beak to tail.

Acanthopholis (meaning "spiny scales") was an armored, quadrupedal
(walked on four legs), plant-eating dinosaur from the early Cretaceous
period.  Its armor was rows of oval plates set into its skin, plus it had
spikes jutting out of its neck and shoulder area along the spine.  It was
about 15 feet long (4 m) and weighed roughly 380 kg.  This huge, heavy
reptile was an herbivore (it ate only plants).  It had to eat a huge amount
of low-lying plant material to sustain itself so its gut must have been very
large.  It probably had a fermentation compartment to aid in the digestion
of the tough plant material, producing prodigious amounts of gas.

Acrocanthosaurus (meaning "high-spine lizard" because of the spikes
growing out of its spine) was a fierce predator that was roughly 30-40 feet
(9-12 m) long and weighed about 5,000 pounds (2300 kg).  It had a big head,
with a 4.  5 foot (1.  4 m) long skull and 68 thin, sharp, serrated teeth. 
It had 17-inch (43 cm) spikes extending from its vertebrae, along the neck
and tail, that may have formed a thick, fleshy sail on its back.  It had
powerful arms, and each hand had three fingers, equipped with long,
sickle-like claws.

Albertosaurus, also known as Gorgosaurus, was a relative of Tyrannosaurus
rex; Albertosaurus was smaller than T.  Rex and lived a few million years
earlier.  Albertosaurus walked on two legs and had a large head with sharp,
saw-toothed teeth.  It had two-fingered hands on short arms.  Its long tail
provided balance and quick turning.  It had powerful back legs with clawed,
three-toed feet.  Albertosaurus was about 30 feet (9 m) long, about 11 feet
(3.  4 m) tall at the hips, and up to 3 tons in weight (averaging roughly
2500 kg).  The lower jaw of Albertosaurus had from 14 and 16 teeth; the
upper jaw had 17-19 teeth.  It had one row of teeth in each jaw but had at
least one replacement tooth growing up from under each tooth.

Amargasaurus (named from La Armaga, a canyon in Argentina where the
fossil was found) was a sauropod from the early Cretaceous period.  This
plant-eater was about 33 feet (10 m) long and weighed roughly 5000 kg.  It
had 2 rows of spines growing out along its backbone along its neck, body,
and tail.  These spines may have have a covering of skin forming a sail (or
two).  If so, this sail might have been a thermoregulatory structure, used
to absorb and release heat, for mating and dominance rituals, and/or for
making it look much larger than it was to predators.  Otherwise, the spines
may have been useful as protection.  Amargasaurus was a quadruped (it walked
on four legs), had a small head, a long neck and a very long tail.  Its
front legs were shorter than its back legs, and all the legs had
elephant-like, five-toed feet.  One toe on each foot had a thumb claw,
probably for protection.  It may have used its whip-like tail for
protection.

lightly built and with longer legs.  It had short arms, a long, pointy tail,
three hoofed toes, mitten-like hands, a flat, sloping head with a toothless
beak, cheek pouches, and hundreds of closely-packed cheek teeth that ground
up its food.  It was a biped (it walked on two legs) that could also walk on

It had a small crest on its snout.  It had a long, straight neck (unlike
other theropods, who had s-shaped necks) and a long tail.  Its low-slung
body was supported by 2 large rear legs and 2 slightly smaller arms.  It was
a carnivorous dinosaur from the early Cretaceous period, about 125 million

and weighing up to 20 tons (roughly 28000 kg).  It was much smaller than its
fellow sauropods.  It had a small, long head with a blunt snout and
spoon-shaped teeth.  Its neck and tail were shorter than most other
sauropods.  It had thick legs with five-toed feet; the inner toe had a long,
sharp claw for protection.  The front legs were only a bit shorter than its
back legs, making its back almost level to the ground.  Its name, "chambered
lizard," comes from the holes in its vertebrae that decrease its weight.

~
Euoplocephalus was a large armored dinosaur, measuring about 20 feet (6
m) long; it weighed about 2 tons.  Its wide head had a horny, toothless
beak, small, peg-like cheek teeth, bony horns, and a small brain.  Its
entire top side was heavily protected from carnivores with thick, oval
plates embedded (fused) in its leathery skin, rows of large spikes along its
body, large horns that projected from the back of the head, and a raised,
club-like tail.  It even had bony plates as protection for its eyes and a
pair of big spines on the sides of its head.  Only its under-belly was
unplated.  Flipping it over was the only way to wound it.

A behemoth of a dinosaur shatters the earth as it walks around clumsily.
~
The biggest meat-eating dinosaur ever discovered is Giganotosaurus, a
47-foot long behemoth, who weighed about 8 tons and stood 12 feet tall (at
the hips).  It walked on two legs, had a brain the size of a banana, and had
enormous jaws with 8-inch long serrated teeth in a 6 feet (1.  8 m) long
skull.  Giganotosaurus was a theropod from the mid-Cretaceous, living about
100-95 million years ago, toward the end of the Mesozoic Era, the "Age of
Reptiles".  Giganotosaurus was probably bigger than Tyrannosaurus rex , who
was about 40-50 feet long, about 5 tons in weight and about 10 feet tall at
the hips.  Giganotosaurus, however, was more lightly built and had a much
smaller brain case.  Giganotosaurus lived about 30 million years before
Tyrannosaurus rex, which was among the last of the dinosaur species alive
before the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction 65 million years ago.

Homalocephale was a thick-skulled, plant-eating dinosaur.  Its flat head
housed a very thick skull, a tiny brain, and large eyes.  The skull
consisted of porous, non-rigid bone interlaced with blood vessels. 
Homalocephale grew to be about 5 feet long (1.  5 m) and weighed about 95
pounds (43 kg).  Homalocephale probably had a good sense of smell.  It had
bumpy knobs on its snout and along the rear of its skull.  It had
leaf-shaped teeth, short forelimbs and stiff tail.  Running and
flank-butting (ramming into an enemy's body with the head) were probably the
first line of self-defense.

Janenschia (named after Werner Janensch) was a giant plant-eating
dinosaur.  This enormous dinosaur had a long neck, and a long tail.  It was
about 80 feet (24 m) long.  Janenschia walked on four thick legs.  The
hindlimbs had claws that were up to 4 3/4 feet (1.  38 m) long.  Janenschia,
like some other titanosaurids, may have been covered with armored scales,
but there is no fossils evidence of this.  Although many sauropods may have
travelled in herds, bonebeds of Janenschia fossils have not been found -
only an incomplete fossil has been unearthed.  Janenschia may have been a
solitary animal.  This huge dinosaur was an herbivore (it ate only plants). 
It must have eaten a tremendous amount of plant material each day to sustain
itself.  It swallowed leaves whole, without chewing them, and may have had
gastroliths (stomach stones) in its stomachs to help digest this tough plant
material.

~
Kentrosaurus measured up to 17 feet long (5 m) and weighed about 2 tons,
but its small brain was the size of a walnut.  Its skull was long and
narrow, with a toothless beak and small cheek teeth.  Its head was carried
close to the ground.  It had hoof-like claws on its toes.  Kentrosaurus had
two rows of bony plates that were embedded in its back, that went from its
neck to its mid-section.  A double row of spikes ran from its mid-section to
its tail, and a pair spikes protected its shoulders.  Since these were not
attached to its bones, no one is sure exactly how they were positioned. 
Also, the function of the plates is uncertain; perhaps they were for
temperature regulation, since they contained networks of blood vessels, or
maybe they were for protection or mating display purposes.  The spikes were
used as protection from predators.  Kentrosaurus walked slowly on four legs.
Its back legs were twice as long as its front legs; this probably allowed
the dinosaur to stand up briefly on its hind legs to forage for high
vegetation.

the newly found Sauroposeidon.  Mamenchisaurus' neck was about 46 feet (14
m).  It had 19 vertebrae in its neck, more than any other known dinosaur
had.  Mamenchisaurus was about 70 to 80 feet (21 to 25 m) long and weighed
roughly 12 tons (11 tonnes).  Its hind legs were longer than the front legs;
these hind legs were similar to the legs of Diplodocus.  Its skull however,
was box-shaped (unlike Diplodocus' elongated snout).  Mamenchisaurus was an
herbivore (it ate only plants).  It must have eaten a tremendous amount of
plant material each day to sustain itself.  It swallowed leaves whole,

6 feet long (1.  8 m) and weighed about 900 pounds (400 kg). 
Montanoceratops was probably a herding animal, like the other Ceratopsians. 
This hypothesis is supported by the finding of bone beds, large deposits of
bones of the same species in an area, and large groups of nests.  Each nest
had 12 or more eggs, laid in a spiral fashion.  Males may have had larger
frills than females, indicating that the frill may have been used in
courtship and mating.

An ornitholestes runs around hunting for prey.
~
Ornitholestes was a carnivore that walked on two long legs, was lightly
built, and must have been a very fast runner.  It had a small head, a small
bony crest on its long snout, many sharp teeth, an s-shaped neck, and a
long, tapered tail.  Its arms were short and strong; it had long, clawed,
four-fingered hands (one finger of which was tiny).  Its long tail was
probably used for balance and agility, allowing this predator to change
directions quickly as it chased prey.  Ornitholestes was about 6.  5 feet (2
m) long (from snout to tail) and weighed roughly 25 pounds (12 kg). 
Ornitholestes was a carnivore, a meat eater.  It may also have been a
scavenger.  It may have hunted the newly evolved Jurassic period birds.

6-8 feet (1.  8-2.  4 m) tall.  About half of its length was its neck and
tail.  It had short arms with three clawed fingers on each hand, and long
legs with three clawed toes on each foot.  A long tail acted as a
counterbalance and as a stabilizer during fast turns.  Its bones were
hollow.  Ornithomimus was an omnivore, eating both plant and animal matter,
including insects, small reptiles and mammals, eggs, fruit, and leaves.

cheek pouches.  This plant eater was bipedal (walked on two legs).  It had
thin legs and a stiffened tail that gave it speed and agility.  It had
five-fingered hands and four-toed feet, all clawed.  It had large eyes and
short arms.  Othnielia resembled Hypsilophodon (but had longer feet and

~
Ouranosaurus was a sail-backed, plant-eating, Iguanodontid dinosaur from
the early Cretaceous period.  It was about 24 feet (7 m) long and may have
weighed about 4 tons.  Ouranosaurus' sail was formed from its long-spined
backbone sticking out from its back and tail that was covered with skin. 
The sail was probably used for emperature regulation in the hot, African
environment.  It would help the animal cool down in the heat of day, by
dispersing extra heat when the sail was turned away from the sun.  It would
also help Ouranosaurus collect heat early in the morning when the sail faced
the sun.  The sail may also have been used for mating displays, intraspecies
rivalry, or to make it look larger when confronting predators.  Ouranosaurus
had few defenses.  Ouranosaurus was an herbivore, a plant eater.  It
probably ate leaves, fruit, seeds, and other plant material with its tough
beak.  It had no teeth in its beak, but had many cheek teeth that it used
for grinding up tough plant material.

Oviraptor was a small, bird-like, omnivorous dinosaur.  It was about 6 to
8 feet long (1.  8 to 2.  5 m), weighing about 55 to 76 pounds (25 to 35
kg).  It was lightly built, fast-moving, long-legged, and bipedal (it walked
on two legs).  It had a curved, flexible, s-shaped neck, a long tail, short,
strong arms, and curved claws on its three-fingered hands and three-toed
feet.  The claws on its large hands were about 3 inches (8 cm) long.  Its
fingers were long and grasping.  Ts strangely-shaped, parrot-like head had a
short, toothless beak and extremely powerful jaws, built for crushing
action.  Oviraptors had a small, stumpy, horn-like crest on its snout,
probably used for a mating display; differences in these crests may
represent different oviraptor species or the difference between the male,
female, and juvenile of the species.  Oviraptor was probably an omnivore,
which is unusual for dinosaurs.  It probably ate meat, eggs, seeds, insects,
plants, etc.  With its beak and powerful jaws.  Oviraptor (meaning "egg
stealer") was thought to eat mostly eggs.  In 1924, an Oviraptor fossil was
found on top of some eggs (which contained no fossilized embryos), and
people assumed that it had been eating the eggs.

Pachycephalosaurus was a dome-headed dinosaur.  Its huge head housed an

up to10 inches thick (25 cm).  Pachycephalosaurus grew to be about 15 feet
long (4.  6 m) and may have weighed roughly 950 pounds (430 kg). 
Pachycephalosaurus probably had a good sense of smell.  It had bumpy knobs
on its snout and along the rear of its skull.  This plant-eater had short
forelimbs and a stiff tail (which had a distinctive mesh of interwoven
tendons surrounding its rear portion).  Pachycephalosaurs were herding
dinosaurs that lived in small groups in coastal and upland regions.  Running
was probably the first line of self-defense.  Pachycephalosaurus was an
herbivore, eating soft plants, fruit, and seeds.  Its teeth were small and
sharp.

~
Parasaurolophus was an herbivore, eating pine needles, leaves, and twigs.
Fossilized stomach contents have been found, consisting mostly of land
plants.  Parasaurolophus was a long-crested, duck-billed dinosaur.  Its
extremely long, backwards-leaning, hollow, bony crest was as bigger than the
rest of its skull and may have been used to produce low-frequency,
foghorn-like sounds, enhance its sense of smell, and/or used in courtship
displays.  The Parasaurolophus' nostrils (at he end of its snout) went up
through the crest and back down it, forming four tubes.  The crest was up to
6 feet (1.  8 m) long.  Its snout was narrow and shorter than other
hadrosaur snouts.  There may have been sex differences in the length of the
crest; males may have had longer crests.  Parasaurolophus also had a notch
in its back, right where the crest would touch the back when its head leaned
backwards.  Parasaurolophus grew to be about 33 feet long (10 m) and 16 feet
(5 m) tall.  It weighed about 3 to 4 tons.  It had pebbly-textured skin, a
spoon-shaped beak, and a pointy tail.  It may have had webbed fingers,
giving it a mitten-like hand, but some paleontologists argue that the
web-like fossilized hands are an artifact of the fossilization process.  Its
sight and hearing were keen, but it had no natural defenses.  It had a
toothless, horny beak and numerous cheek teeth.

Pentaceratops was a rhinoceros-like dinosaur.  It walked on four sturdy
legs and had three horns on its face along with a large bony plate
projecting from the back of its skull (a frill).  One upward-pointing horn
above its parrot-like beak and two longer, forward-pointing horns above its
eyes probably provided protection from predators, and were possibly used in
mating rivalry and rituals.  It also had two enlarged, horn-like cheekbones
that protruded from its face.  It had a very large skull, 9.  8 feet (3 m)
long, with a very large, bony, scalloped, head frill.  It has the
largest-known skull ever found (for a land-dwelling animal).  Pentaceratops
was about was up to 28 feet (8 m) long, roughly 10 feet tall (3 m), and
weighed up to 8 tons.  It had a short, pointed tail, a bulky body,
column-like legs with hoof-like claws, and a bony, scalloped neck frill
rimmed with bony points.  It had a parrot-like beak, many cheek teeth, and
powerful jaws.  Pentaceratops hatched from eggs.  Pentaceratops was an
herbivore, a plant eater.  It probably ate cycads, palms, and other
prehistoric plants with its tough, toothless beak.  It could also chew well
with its cheek teeth (like other Ceratopsians, but unlike most other
dinosaurs).

Plateosaurus was a large, early herbivore that was about 27.  5 feet (8
m) long and weighed about 1,500 pounds (700 kg).  It had a long neck, very
long tail, a small head with a long snout, and large, five-fingered hands
with a large thumb claw (and smaller claws on the other fingers). 
Plateosaurus may have been able to use its hand for grasping in addition to
walking.  Its back legs were larger than its front legs.  It was a very
common dinosaur in Europe during the late Triassic period.  Plateosaurus may
have congregated in herds, and may have migrated seasonally across the arid
(dry) European landscape during the late Triassic period.  Plateosaurus was
one of the first tall, long-necked herbivores (plant eaters).  It was
probably able to rear up on its back legs in order to graze on tall
vegetation, like conifers and cycads.  Its sharp teeth let it tear these
tough leaves from the plants.  It may have swallowed pebbles and small
stones to help in the digestion of the tough leaves and other plant material
that it ate.  These gizzard stones (gastroliths) would help grind up the
food in the stomach.

Protarchaeopteryx (meaning "early ancient wing") was a feathered theropod
dinosaur dating from the late Jurassic period to perhaps the early
Cretaceous period, roughly 121-135 million years ago.  The fossil was found
near Yianxin, Liaoning Province, China, in sediment from an ancient lake
bed.  Protarchaeopteryx is more primitive than Archaeopteryx, the
earliest-known bird.  Protarchaeopteryx had feathers covering its short
arms, most of its body, and as a fan on its short tail.  Its feathers were
symmetrical, which indicated that it did not fly (modern-day flightless
birds have symmetrical feathers; flying birds have asymmetrical ones). 
Protarchaeopteryx's feathers may have been used for insulation, retaining in
its body heat.  Protarchaeopteryx had long legs, short arms, and was about
the size of a turkey, about 3 feet (1 m) tall.  It lacked the typical long
theropod tail but had a short, feathered tail.

Saurolophus was a duck-billed dinosaur that had a 5 inch (13 cm) long
bony spike extending up from its forehead.  There is speculation that this
spike was attached to a flap of skin that covered the nostrils and could be
blown up for displays and noise-making.  Saurolophus was about 30-40 feet
(9-12 m) long, had a long, pointy tail, short arms, three-hoofed toes and, a
flat, sloping head with a toothless beak, cheek pouches, and hundreds of
closely-packed cheek teeth that ground up its food.  The top bill of its
beak curled slightly upwards.  Saurolophus also had a sclerotic ring, a ring
of bones around its eyes - it was the first duckbill found with one.  It was
a biped that could also walk on four legs, perhaps to graze low-lying
plants.  Saurolophus was an herbivore, a plant eater.  It probably ate
conifer needles, twigs, seeds, and other plant material with its tough beak.
It had no teeth in its beak, but had hundreds of cheek teeth used for
grinding up the tough plant material that it ate.

Sauropelta was an armored dinosaur from the early Cretaceous period.  It
looked a lot like its more advanced relative Ankylosaurus, but didn't have
the bony nodes at the end of its tail or horns on its head.  It was about 25
feet (7.  6 m) long and weighed over 3 tons.  It had a narrow skull with
massive jaws, small, leaf-shaped cheek teeth and a toothless horny beak.  It
had horn-covered plates embedded in its skin all over its body (except on
its underbelly).  It's entire top side was heavily protected from
carnivores.  Only its under-belly was unplated.  Flipping it over was the
only way to wound it.  This huge, heavy reptile was an herbivore (it ate
only plants).  It had to eat a huge amount of low-lying plant material to
sustain itself so its gut must have been very large.  It probably had a
fermentation compartment to aid in the digestion of the tough plant
material, producing prodigious amounts of gas.

A scipionyx samnticus scavenges for food.

One of the most important recent dinosaur finds is a tiny theropod
(meat-eater) fossil found in Cretaceous limestone in southern Italy near
Naples.  Although it was unearthed 10 years ago, its true importance was not
realized until lately.  It is a very important specimen in that it has
fossilized impressions of many of its internal organs and muscles.  This
type of detail is rare in fossils since the soft tissues from an animal do
not usually fossilize; they almost always rot before mineral replacement can
take place.  This new fossil will yield a lot of information about
dinosaur's anatomy and physiology as it is studied.  The fossils is a
theropod, perhaps a maniraptor (related to Velociraptor).  It is a hatchling
9.  5 inches (24 cm) long.  It is from 113 million years ago (during the
Cretaceous period) and has been named Scipionyx samniticus.  During the
Cretaceous period it lived near a shallow lagoon.

~
Seismosaurus was a long-necked, whip-tailed, small-headed dinosaur,
measuring about 130-170 feet (39-52 m) long.  It may have weighed about 30
tons (roughly 60,000 pounds).  It was among the longest land animals ever. 
Its nostrils were at the top of its head.  Its small mouth had peg-like
teeth, but only in the front of the jaws.  Its front legs were shorter than
its back legs, and all had elephant-like, five-toed feet.  Its short legs
may have helped stabilize this enormous dinosaur.  One toe on each foot had
a thumb claw, probably for protection.  Its backbone had extra bones
underneath it, which had bony protrusions running both forwards and
backwards (chevron shaped), probably for support and extra mobility of its
neck and tail.  Seismosaurus' tail contained at least one unusual
wedge-shaped vertebra that gave it a kink.  It may have used this whip-like
tail for protection.  Seismosaurus was an herbivore (it ate only plants). 
Seismosaurus had blunt, peg-like teeth, useful for stripping foliage.  It
must have eaten a tremendous amount of plant material each day to sustain
itself.  It probably swallowed leaves whole, without chewing them, and had
gastroliths (stomach stones) in its stomach to help digest this tough plant
material.  Many of these fossilized gastroliths have been found in the
middle of the Seismosaurus skeleton.  Its main food was probably conifers,
which were the dominant plant when the large sauropods lived.  Secondary
food sources may have included Gingkos, seed ferns, cycads and
benettitaliean, ferns, club mosses, and horsetails.

~
Paleontologists have discovered a new meat-eating dinosaur fossil (a
dromaeosaur) in northeast China that may have been covered with a coat of
down-like fibers, early proto-feathers.  This dinosaur dates from about 124
million years ago, during the middle Jurassic period.  Although other
dinosaurs have already been found with feather-like coats, the previous
finds belonged to a more advanced group of dinosaurs.  This new dinosaur is
a dromaeosaur, an earlier type of meat-eating dinosaur.  Other dromaeosaurs
include Velociraptor, Utahraptor, and Deinonychus.  This new fossil suggests
that these dinosaurs may not have had scaly, reptile-like skin, but perhaps
had a softer, downy coat.  No fossil skin impressions of these dinosaurs had
been found previously.  This new find was described by paleontologist
Xiao-Chun Wu of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and
Paleoanthropology of Beijing and the University of Calgary of Alberta,
Canada.  Wu and his colleagues named this new find Sinornithosaurus
millenii, meaning "Chinese bird lizard of the millennium."  Wu et al. 
Describe this fossil in the September 16 issue of the magazine Nature. 
Sinornithosaurus was found in the Yixian rock formation in northeast China
near Sihetun.  This area has yielded an enormous number of fossils in the
last few years - it is one of the richest fossil beds yet discovered.  A few
years ago, dinosaurs like Sinosauropteryx prima, Caudipteryx zoui, and
Beipiaosaurus (Xing Xu, et al.  , 1999) were found there.  These advanced
dinosaurs were also covered with fibers.  Wu contends, "This is further
support for the idea that birds gradually evolved from the theropod
dinosaurs."  Birds may have branched off from the dromaeosaurid dinosaurs
during the mid-Jurassic period, roughly 150 million years ago.  Although
there are scientific dissenters, the majority of paleontologists agree with
Wu about the origin of birds.

spinosaurus jurassis~
a spinosaurus~
A spinosaurs looks around hungrily.
~
Spinosaurus is called "spiny lizard" because it had a series of large
neural spines up to 6 feet (1.  8 m) long coming out if its back vertebrae,
probably forming a sail-like fin that may have helped in thermo-regulation,
mating rituals and/or intraspecies rivalry.  Spinosaurus had a relatively
flexible upper spine (these vertebrae had modified ball-and-socket-joints)
so it could arch its back somewhat, perhaps being able to spread the sail
(like opening the ribs of a fan).  Spinosaurus was bipedal (it walked on two
legs).  It was about 40-50 feet long (12-15 m) and weighed 4 tons or more;
it is the largest known carnosaur (a type of meat-eating dinosaur).  It had
a large head with sharp, straight, non-serrated teeth in a powerful,
crocodile-like lower jaw.  Its arms were smaller than its legs but were
larger than the arms of most other theropods.  It may have gone on all fours
at times.  Spinosaurus' huge sail may have been used for regulating its
temperature.  It could both collect warmth from the sun and disperse excess
body heat during the heat of the day.  The presence of this sail as a
thermo-regulatory device is evidence that Spinosaurus may have been a
cold-blooded animal.  The sail may also have been used for mating rituals,
attracting mates.  The sail may have been brightly colored, like the fins of
some modern-day reptiles.

Stegoceras was a dome-headed, bipedal dinosaur.  Its large head housed a
thick skull, a relatively large brain, and large eyes.  Its skull was about
3-4 inches (8 cm) thick.  Males had thicker domes than females, and older
Stegoceras' had thicker domes than younger ones.  Stegoceras had a fringe of
horny knobs along the rear of its skull, short forelimbs, and a large, stiff
tail.  Stegoceras grew to be about 7 feet long (2.  1 m) and 4 feet tall (1.
2 m).  Stegoceras was a herding dinosaur that lived in small groups in
coastal and upland regions.  Running was probably the first line of
self-defense.

A styracosaurus rolls around in the sand.
~
Styracosaurus was a dinosaur that walked on four short legs.  This large
plant-eater had a six-spiked frill projecting from the back of its skull. 
It also had an upward-pointing horn on its nose (2 feet (60 cm) long and 6
inches (15 cm) wide), and two small horns above its eyes.  These spikes and
the horn probably provided protection from predators, and were possibly used
in mating rituals and rivalry.  It had a short, thick, pointed tail, a
large, bulky body, a large skull and a beak.  Styracosaurus hatched from
eggs.  Styracosaurus was about 18 feet (5 m) long, 6 feet (1.  8 m) tall,
and weighed up to 3 tons.  Styracosaurus was very likely a herding animal,
like other ceratopsians.  This hypothesis is supported by the finding of
bone beds, large deposits of bones of the same species in an area. 
Styracosaurus hatched from eggs, and the young may have been cared for by
parents.  When threatened by predators, Styracosaurus may have charged into
its enemy like a modern-day rhinoceros does.  This would have been a very
effective defense.

A suchomimus fishes in the tepid waters.
~
A new, huge dinosaur with crocodile-like jaws, long, razor-sharp teeth,
and huge curving claws has been found in the Sahara desert.  Paul Sereno, a
paleontologist from the University of Chicago, USA, discovered this new
species, a fish-eating dinosaur from Niger, Africa.  This new predator will
be named Suchomimus tenerensis.  It's a dinosaur trying hard to be a
crocodile....  It was an impressive-sized beast.  If you were standing next
to it, your eye level would be at its knee," said Paul Sereno, who led the
18-member scientific expedition to Niger last year.  "This animal was easily
the size of Tyrannosaurus rex.  And it was not fully grown."  "With its
forearms and its jaws, it would have been able to take down just about
anything," said Sereno.  "It was the dominant predator of its time."  In its
crocodile-like pointed jaw, it had about 100 pointed teeth.  These
razor-sharp teeth faced slightly backwards.  The very end of the snout was
tipped with an extra, chin-like projection, called a rosette, that held the
longest teeth, ideal for grabbing prey.  Suchomimus had a sail-like
structure along its back, perhaps used for regulating its temperature.  This
sail captured heat in the cool mornings, giving the predator an edge on
other cold-blooded animals.  Also, in the sweltering heat of the Cretaceous
afternoons, Suchomimus could dissipate extra heat through its sail.

An extremely long dinosaur, called the supersaurus is here.

SUPERSAURUS is one of the longest land animals yet discovered.  It was a
long-necked, whip-tailed giant, measuring about 138 feet (42 m) long and 54
feet (16.  5 m) tall, with a 39 foot (12 m) long neck.  It may have had very
limited vertical neck mobility.  It may have have weighed up to 55 tons; it
was not the heaviest dinosaur.  Its front legs were shorter than its back
legs, and all the legs had elephant-like, five-toed feet.  One toe on each
foot had a thumb claw, probably for protection.  It may have used its
whip-like tail for protection.  Supersaurus probably travelled in herds and
may have migrated when they depleted their local food supply.  Supersaurus
may have hatched from eggs, like other sauropods.  Sauropod eggs have been
found in a linear pattern and not in nests; presumably the eggs were laid as
the animal was walking.  It is thought that sauropods did not take care of
their eggs.  Sauropod life spans may have been on the order of 100 years. 
Supersaurus was an herbivore (it ate only plants).  It must have eaten a

Syntarsus was a small, lightly-built dinosaur that walked on two long
legs.  This predator was about 10 feet long (3 m) and weighed about 60-70
pounds.  It had light, hollow bones, a long, pointed head with dozens of
small, serrated teeth, and a long neck.  Syntarsus had large, four-fingered
hands with sharp claws.  Syntarsus had four-toed feet with fused ankle bones
(these ankle bones were like those of early ornithopods although it was an
early saurischian dinosaur - these ankle bones were what Syntarsus was named
for).  Syntarsus was a carnivore, a meat eater.  It may also have been a
scavenger.  Fossilized stomach contents have been found, containing small
vertebrates.  Syntarsus probably lived and hunted in packs; this is
suggested by the existence of a fossil bonebed (a collections of many
fossils of one location) of about 30 Syntarsus found in Zimbabwe, Africa.

An ultrosaurus roams around oblivious to any threats.

Ultrasauros was one of the tallest and largest dinosaurs yet found.  It
was a four-legged plant eater with a long, giraffe-like neck held high, a
sloping back, a tiny head, and a medium-length tail.  Estimates of its size
vary since only a very incomplete fossil was found.  Estimates vary from
82-100+ feet long (25-30 m), about 52 feet (15 m) high, and a weight of 55
to 130 tons.  "Ultrasauros machintoshi" may actually be a just very large
example of Brachiosaurus or perhaps even Supersaurus, and not a new genus. 
When more fossils are found, this can be cleared up.  Ultrasauros, like
other sauropods, may have travelled in herds and may have migrated when they
depleted their local food supply.  Ultrasauros may have hatched from eggs,
like other sauropods.  Sauropod eggs have been found in a linear pattern and
not in nests; presumably the eggs were laid as the animal was walking.  It
is thought that sauropods did not take care of their eggs.  Sauropods life
spans may have been in the order of 100 years.  Ultrasauros was an

large spatulate (chisel-shaped) teeth.  It swallowed its food whole, without

an unenlagia comahuensis~
An unenlagia comahuensis makes an awkward attempt at flight, but is always unsuccessful.
~
The most bird-like dinosaur ever discovered is the 90-million-year-old
Unenlagia comahuensis, a flightless, 4-foot tall, 7.  5-foot-long carnivore.
It is the size of an ostrich, but shaped like Velociraptor.  Unenlagia had
flexible arm movement (up and down movements were possible, like that which
a bird uses in flying) - it could also grasp with its clawed, short,
wing-like forearms.  This new fossil helps show how dinosaur forearms
evolved into the wings of modern-day birds.  Unenlagia had a shoulder
structure that allowed its short arms to move forwards, backwards, inwards
(for grasping prey), and up and down (for a flapping motion).  This flapping
motion was not used for flying, because its wing-like arms were too short to
support the heavy dinosaur.  Perhaps these proto-wings were used for
balancing, turning, and a bit of lift during high-speed running.  Although
there is no fossil evidence of feathers from Unenlagia, it may well have had
them, further adding lift to each upstroke of the proto-wings.  Unenlagia
comahuensis was a theropod from the mid-Cretaceous, living about 90 million
years ago.  The first birds appeared 150 million years ago, evolving from
dinosaurs long before Unenlagia lived.  Therefore, it is not an ancestor of
modern-day birds, but was an evolutionary dead-end.

Utahraptor was a large, terrifying mid-Cretaceous predator with 9-15 inch
long middle-toe claws.  It was a lightly built, fast-moving, agile, bipedal
(walked on two legs), bird-like dinosaur.  It had a curved, flexible neck
and a big head.  Sharp, serrated teeth were set into very powerful jaws. 
Each of its three fingers on each arm had large, sharp, curved claw.  It had
four-toed feet; the second toe had a 9-15 inch (25-35 cm) sickle-like claw
and the other toes had smaller claws.  Its long tail had bony rods running
along the spine giving it rigidity; the tail was used for balance and fast
turning ability.  It had a relatively large brain and large, keen, eyes. 
Utahraptor was about 20 feet long (6.  5 m) and may have weighed about 1
ton.  Utahraptor, like other dromaeosaurids, may have hunted in packs,
attacking even very large animals, perhaps even large sauropods and
ankylosaurids.

Wannanosaurus (named after the Chinese province where its very incomplete
skeleton was found) was a tiny homalocephalid dinosaur about 2 feet (60 cm)
long.  It was a very primitive Pachycephalosaur (related to
Pachycephalosaurus and Stegoceras, other dinosaurs with thick skulls that
probably engaged in head-butting activities).  The homalocephalids had
thick, but flat-topped skulls.  It was an herbivore that walked on two
strong legs, had short arms, a stiff tail, and a thick-set body.  (Its
resembles Pachycephalosaurus, but it was much smaller and its head was much
flatter.)  Wannanosaurus may have been a herding dinosaur that lived in
small groups in coastal and upland regions.  Running was probably the first
line of self-defense.  Wannanosaurus' thick skull may have been used for
ramming rivals during mating and dominance combat, for attracting mates, and
as a last-ditch self-defense against predators.  Wannanosaurus was an
herbivore, eating soft plants, fruit, and seeds.  Its teeth were small and
sharp.

A yangchuanosaurus searches for it's dinner.
~
Yangchuanosaurus was a large, powerful meat-eater.  It walked on two
large, muscular legs, had short arms, a strong, short neck, a big head with
powerful jaws, and large, serrated teeth.  It had a long, massive tail that
was about half of its length.  Its feet had three toes, each with a large
claw.  Its arms were short, and it had three clawed fingers on each hand. 
Yangchuanosaurus was up to 33 feet long (10 m).  It had a large skull up to
3.  5 feet (1.  1 m) long with ridges and a bony knob on its snout.  It was
slightly smaller but very similar to its close relative Allosaurus. 
Yangchuanosaurus was a hunter that may have stalked prey in packs.

A zigongosaurus grazes.
~
Zigongosaurus was a large quadrupedal (walked on four legs) herbivore. 
It was a about 35 feet (10.  7 m) long and may have weighed about 20 tons. 
It had a long neck, a long tail, a small head with spoon-shaped teeth, and
thick, elephant-like legs.  Zigongosaurus was an herbivore, a plant eater. 
It stripped foliage with spoon-shaped teeth.  Zigongosaurus may have
travelled in herds and migrated when they depleted their local food supply. 
Zigongosaurus may have hatched from eggs, like other sauropods.  Sauropod
eggs have been found in a linear pattern and not in nests; presumably the
eggs were laid as the animal was walking.  It is thought that sauropods did
not take care of their eggs.  Sauropods life spans may have been in the
order of 100 years.

An archelon swims around here.
~
Archelon was huge marine turtle (a chelonian) that was the size of a car.
It lived during the time of the dinosaurs, but it was not a dinosaur.  This
carnivore was about 10-13 feet (3-4 m) long.  Archelon had a wide, flattened
shell, paddle-like legs, a long, narrow head, weak jaws, and a pointed tail.
The shell was not like that of modern-day turtles; it did not have the
numerous shell bones of modern-day tortoises.  Archelon's back probably had
a leathery covering or horny plates over a bony framework on its back. 
Archelon was a carnivore (meat-eater).  It had very weak jaws and may have
eaten jellyfish.

A dimetrodon slithers through the sands.
~
The dimetrodon reached 11.  5 feet (3.  5 m) long and weighed about 550
pounds (250 kg).  Its fossils have been found in North America.  It had a
large sail-like flap of skin along its back, dense with blood vessels.  It
was supported by long, bony spines, each of which grew out of a separate
spinal vertebra.  This flap might have been a thermoregulatory structure,
used to absorb and release heat, for mating and dominance rituals, and/or
for making it look much larger than it was to predators.  Dimetrodon was a
dominant carnivore during the Permian period, living mainly in swampy areas.
Unlike their fellow non-finned pelycosaurs, they warmed up earlier after
sunrise and cooled off more efficiently in the heat of the day.  This
efficient thermoregulation along with their large and powerful jaws gave
them the advantage over their cohorts, giving them dominance.  Dimetrodon
probably sunned itself every day to raise its temperature and leave its
cold, sluggish, night-time state.  Its sail sped up this process enormously.
It has been calculated that an average adult dimetrodon (weighing about 440
pounds = 200 kg) would take about 1 1/2 hours to raise its temperature from
79C to 90C (26C to 32C).

A dimorphodon swoops through the skies.
~
Dimorphodon (meaning "two-form tooth") was a pterosaur with a 4 feet (1. 
2 m) long wingspan.  It was not a dinosaur, but type of extinct, flying
reptile.  It had a huge head with deep, wide, toothed jaws resembling the
beak of the modern-day puffin, a short neck, and a diamond-shaped flap of
skin at the end of the long, pointed tail.  Its disproportionately large
head may have been for courtship rituals.  Unlike most other pterosaurs,
Dimorphodon's legs sprawled out at the sides.  Making its walking gait
clumsy.  This might indicate that Dimorphodon spent much of its non-flying
time hanging from cliffs or tree braches, holding on with its toe claws. 
Dimorphodon was a carnivore and probably ate fish.

~
Dsungaripterus was a pterosaur with 10 feet (3 m) wide leathery wings. 
It had an unusual bony crest running along its snout and had long, narrow,
curved jaws with a pointed tip.  The crest may have acted as a rudder when
flying or may have been a sexual characteristic.  It had flat teeth at the
back of the jaws, probably for crushing the shells of its prey.  It was not
a dinosaur, but a type of extinct, flying reptile.  They were lightly built
with hollow bones, long, curved necks, long skulls, and small bodies.  They
had large brains and good eyesight.  Dsungaripterus wings were covered by a
leathery membrane.  This thin but tough membrane stretched between its body,
the top of its legs and its elongated fourth fingers, forming the structure
of the wing.  Claws protruded from the other fingers.  Dsungaripterus was a
carnivore It probably ate fish (which it caught at the surface of the
oceans), mollusks, crabs, perhaps plankton (for some species), insects, and
scavenged dead animals on land.

A pleiosaur swims around contendedly.
~
Plesiosaurs (meaning "near lizard") were flippered marine reptiles from
the Mesozoic Era - they were not dinosaurs.  Plesiosaurs are divided into
two groups: the Plesiosauroids with long, snake-like necks, tiny heads, and
wide bodies, and the Pliosauroids, which had large heads with very strong
jaws and short necks.  Plesiosaurs were large, marine reptiles from the
Mesozoic Era that ranged in size from 8-46 feet long (2.  5-14 m).  They had
four flippers, sharp teeth in strong jaws, and short, pointed tails. 
Plesiosaurs may have evolved from the Nothosaurs or Pistosaurus, a
mid-Triassic reptile.  No one knows how the long-necked plesiosaurs held
their necks; either they held the neck horizontally, or else it was supple
and could move readily.  Plesiosaurs lived in the open oceans and breathed
air.  Some Plesiosaurs have been found with small stones in their stomachs;
these may have been used to help grind up their food, or as ballast, to help
them dive.  They probably laid eggs in beach sand (like modern-day sea
turtles).

Ichthyosaurs were reptiles that were strong swimmers fully adapted to
life in the seas.  They were better adapted than any other reptiles,
although they still needed to go to the surface periodically to breathe air.
Ichthyosaurs were stream-lined marine reptiles that ranged in size from 7-30
feet long (4.  5-9 m).  They had sharp teeth in long jaws, and big eyes. 
They had four crescent-shaped fins, a stabilizing dorsal fin, and a
fish-like tail with two lobes.  They breathed air with lungs through
nostrils which were close to the the eyes near the top of the snout.  They
gave birth to live young; fossils have been found with baby Ichthyosaurs in
the abdomen.  --> Kercpa has left real life behind.  Ichthyosaurs were
carnivores; they ate fish, octopus, and other swimming animals.  They had
strong jaws and sharp teeth.

Nothosaurs were long-necked, long-tailed, fish-eating reptiles ranging
from a few inches to 20 feet (6 m) long - they were not dinosaurs. 
Nothosaurs had four wide, paddle-like limbs with webbed fingers and toes. 
These reptiles had a long, thin head with many sharp teeth; the front teeth
were longer than the back teeth.  The nostrils were on the top end of the
snout.  They breathed air but spent most of the time in the water. 
Nothosaurs breathed air and lived on land but were able to swim in the water
with their paddle-like limbs.  They probably laid their eggs on land but
hunted and ate in the sea.  Nothosaurs ate fish and other small swimming
animals like shrimp.  They fished using their sharp teeth in a long snout. 
Nothosaurs could walk on four legs and also swim using their paddle-like
limbs with webbed digits (fingers and toes) and long tail.  Nothosaurs were
reptiles, but not dinosaurs.

Pterosaurs were flying reptiles that ranged in size from a few inches to
over 40 feet.  They had hollow bones, were lightly built, and had small
bodies.  They had large brains and good eyesight.  Some pterosaurs had fur
on their bodies, and some (like Pteranodon) had light-weight, bony crests on
their heads that may have acted as a rudder when flying, or may have been a
sexual characteristic.  Pterosaur wings were covered by a leathery membrane.
This thin but tough membrane stretched between its body, the top of its legs

protruded from the other fingers.  Pterosaurs could flap their wings and fly
with power, but the largest ones (like Quetzalcoatlus, which had a wingspan
up to 39 feet or 12 m wide) probably relied on updrafts (rising warm air)
and breezes to help in flying.  Pterosaurs were carnivores; they ate fish

A quetzalcoatlus ruffles it's wings in preparation for flight.
~
Quetzalcoatlus was a flying reptile whose wing-span was over 40 feet wide
(12 m).  It was the largest flying animal ever found.  It had hollow bones,
was lightly built, and had a small body.  Even though it was very big, it
probably weighed only about 110 pounds (50 kg).  It had a long, thin beak,
toothless jaws, a small head, and a long neck (up to 2.  4 m long).  They
had large brains and good eyesight.  Fur covered their bodies, and a
light-weight, bony crests on the head may have acted as a rudder for flying.
The crest may also have been a sexual characteristic.  Quetzalcoatlus wings
were covered by a leathery membrane.  This thin but tough membrane stretched
between its body, the top of its legs and its elongated fourth fingers,
forming the structure of the wing.  Claws protruded from the other fingers. 
Quetzalcoatlus probably relied on updrafts (rising warm air) and breezes to
help it in flying.  Quetzalcoatlus was a carnivore and probably also a
scavenger.  It lived inland from the sea, near fresh-water ponds (so its
diet was not primarily sea fishes and marine mollusks like other
pterosaurs).  It probably ate arthropods (like early crayfish) and also
available carcasses and dying animals.  It probably hunted its prey by
gliding toward the ground and swooping up its meals (in a manner similar to
modern-day vultures).  It filtered its food through its long, pointed,
toothless jaws.  Quetzalcoatlus must have had good eyesight in order to spot
meals from the air.

The Jungle~
Enormous trees threaten to eclipse out the sun during the day and
enshroud the jungle in pitch black darkness at night.  Grass grows in odd
patches on the ground and strange red and orange flowers provide the only
distinct colorings in the jungle.  Everything else seems to meld together.

A rather large animal path seems to cut its way through the dense foliage
of the jungle.  The ground has been trampled clear through such that a find
sand path has been worn.  It is not clear what created the path but it is
obvious that it was large.  The path seems to run in an north-south route.

The edge of the jungle~
Tall thin grasses eclipse most of the view.  Moss hangs down from immense
trees and entwines itself within the tall grasses creating a psuedo wall
around the jungle.  The earth trembles and shakes and loud baying sounds can
be heard from within the wetlands.

Sandy Beach~
The rolling surf crashes gently up the beautiful white beaches.  Long
expanses run across the entire length of the island like a shield against
the harshness of the sea.  The surface is perfect save for the occation
creature checking out the sea or the carcass of a large animal that may have
washed ashore, even now being fed apon by the scavengers on the island.  The
jungle comes right to the shore to the west.

A mountain~
A small mountain errupts at the edge of the jungle.  Large paths have
been carved into it's sides from violent lava flows in ages past.  Plants
grow sporadically, timidly trying to reclaim their place amongst the rocks. 
The slope is too steep to climb here making the only choice back to the
jungles to the north and west or further around the mountain.

Outcropping~
A large jumble of rocks has fallen here as though blown from the top of
the mountain itself.  Its black sulfuric surface glistens as some sort of
white substance dots its surface.  Nestled between the boulders, a rather
large nest has been made.  The ledge continues east and west.  There appears
to be no way down short of falling.

The Jungle~
Enormous trees threaten to eclipse out the sun during the day and
enshroud the jungle in pitch black darkness at night.  Grass grows in odd
patches on the ground and strange red and orange flowers provide the only
distinct colorings in the jungle.  Everything else seems to meld together.

A path through the Jungle~
A rather large animal path seems to cut its way through the dense foliage
of the jungle.  The ground has been trampled clear through such that a find
sand path has been worn.  It is not clear what created the path but it is
obvious that it was large.  The path seems to run in an north-south route.

A mountain~
A small mountain errupts at the edge of the jungle.  Large paths have
been carved into it's sides from violent lava flows in ages past.  Plants
grow sporadically, timidly trying to reclaim their place amongst the rocks. 
The mountain rises less steeply here allowing for access further up.  The
jungle rises up to the west and north while to the south a large flow of
lava impeeds further progress.

The mountain~
The mountain begins to rise steadily here above what is now evidently
obvious, an island.  Lose rocks make the footing somewhat treacherous but
most of the rock is smoothed from ancient lava flows.  A still flowing
stream of magma blocks access south but the mountain continues to wind
around to the north.  The ground slopes fairly gently back down towards the
jungle floor here while also granting further access to the top of the
mountain.

Top of the Mountain~
From the top of the mountain one can see for miles in every direction. 
The blue disc of the ocean surrounds the island like a mother its young. 
Far to the east of the island you can see a rising plateau and the swamps to
the southeast.  The well defined cliffs difine the northern border while to
the west a sandy beach glistens like snow.  The mating call of what sounds
to be a very large animal echos in the distance.  The center of the mountain
is east while the ground slopes slightly here leading westward down the
mountain.

The top of the mountain~
The mountain shudders in anger.  You realize that you are walking on the
edge of a volcano.  The lava has hardened enough to cover the erruption
hole, but it is evident that nothing can contain the fury of the volcano for
much longer.  You'd better get out while you can!  The flow of lava heads
southward and west down the mountain.

Mountain~
The edge of the mountain drops off quite steeply here making access up
and down fairly impossible.  A slight breeze is mixed with a tinge of sulfur
making ones eyes sting when sweat enters them.  A narrow ledge runs in a
north-south direction.  The trail slopes slightly here allowing access to
the top of the mountain.

The Jungle~
Enormous trees threaten to eclipse out the sun during the day and
enshroud the jungle in pitch black darkness at night.  Grass grows in odd
patches on the ground and strange red and orange flowers provide the only
distinct colorings in the jungle.  Everything else seems to meld together.

A path through the Jungle~
A rather large animal path seems to cut its way through the dense foliage
of the jungle.  The ground has been trampled clear through such that a find
sand path has been worn.  It is not clear what created the path but it is
obvious that it was large.  The path seems to run in an north-south route.

The edge of the jungle~
Tall thin grasses eclipse most of the view.  Moss hangs down from immense
trees and entwines itself within the tall grasses creating a psuedo wall
around the jungle.  The earth trembles and shakes and loud baying sounds can
be heard from within the wetlands.

A mountain~
A small mountain errupts at the edge of the jungle.  Large paths have
been carved into it's sides from violent lava flows in ages past.  Plants
grow sporadically, timidly trying to reclaim their place amongst the rocks. 
The mountain rises less steeply here alowing for access further up.  The
jungle rises up to the west and south while to the north a large flow of
lava impeeds further progress.

The mountain~
The mountain begins to rise steadily here above what is now evidently
obvious, an island.  Lose rocks make the footing somewhat treacherous but
most of the rock is smoothed from ancient lava flows.  A still flowing
stream of magma blocks access north but the mountain continues to wind
around to the east.  The ground slopsfairly gently back down towards the
jungle floor here.

The Jungle~
Enormous trees threaten to eclipse out the sun during the day and
enshroud the jungle in pitch black darkness at night.  Grass grows in odd
patches on the ground and strange red and orange flowers provide the only
distinct colorings in the jungle.  Everything else seems to meld together.

A path through the Jungle~
A rather large animal path seems to cut its way through the dense foliage
of the jungle.  The ground has been trampled clear through such that a find
sand path has been worn.  It is not clear what created the path but it is
obvious that it was large.  The path seems to run in an north-south route.

Tar Pits~
>>Plunk!!  << What at first appeared to be a small clearing in the jungle
turns out to be far more sinister.  It is the bane of all animals of
Jurrassis.  It is the enemy that cannot be defeated.  It is the tar pit. 
Its roiling surface sits calmly, covered enticingly with berries, till an
unsuspecting beast barges through the jungle.  Once in its grasp there is no
escape.  Vines hang tantalizingly close to the edge but in the end are
impossible to reach.  Slowly but as surely as the sun rises, whatever is in
grasp sinks to its depths below.

water here however is rich in food attracting beasts here to feed, both big
and huge.

A path through the Jungle~
A rather large animal path seems to cut its way through the dense foliage
of the jungle.  The ground has been trampled clear through such that a find
sand path has been worn.  It is not clear what created the path but it is
obvious that it was large.  The path turns both north and east here.

The Jungle~
Enormous trees threaten to eclipse out the sun during the day and
enshroud the jungle in pitch black darkness at night.  Grass grows in odd
patches on the ground and strange red and orange flowers provide the only
distinct colorings in the jungle.  Everything else seems to meld together.

The water underfoot is covered with a blue-green moss which parts as you

Sandy Beach~
The rolling surf crashes gently up the beautiful white beaches.  Long
expanses run across the entire length of the island like a shield against
the harshness of the sea.  The surface is perfect save for the occation
creature checking out the sea or the carcass of a large animal that may have
washed ashore, even now being fed apon by the scavengers on the island.  The
jungle comes right to the shore to the north.

The Jungle~
Enormous trees threaten to eclipse out the sun during the day and
enshroud the jungle in pitch black darkness at night.  Grass grows in odd
patches on the ground and strange red and orange flowers provide the only
distinct colorings in the jungle.  Everything else seems to meld together.

The Swamp~
The water underfoot is covered with a blue-green moss which parts as you
move around to reveal small swamp life in it's shallow waters.  Tall, tall,
trees eclipse the skies above, and long tendrils of greenery descend from
the tops of the trees to skim lightly along the water of the swamp.

Swampy Water~
This water is really mud more than anything else.  It is hard to tell
where the swamp ends and the water begins.  Long tendrils from the swamp
trees hang overhead like grizzly hands seeking something to grasp.  The
water here however is rich in food attracting beasts here to feed, both big
and huge.

Lagoon~
The water here is less clouded here than more towards the swamp.  The

is to the northwest while movement below hints at something unknown.

Beneath the Lagoon~
Strange rock formations and murky water give off an otherworldly feel
here beneath the waters of the lagoon.  Small fish creatures and waving beds
of some pinkish plant whirl about making it nearly impossible to
concentrate.  A few straining strands of sunlight manage to filter down from
aboving hinting at a possible escape route.

Benath the Tar Pits~
Blackness.  It is not readily apparent how one can even see down here but
it is safe to say it would be unwise to stay.  The murky blackness seems to
hold tight.  Drawing anything in its grasp into itself.  Escape is probably
impossible.  Best to sleep comfortablly in its embracing arms.  To sleep....
To sleep....  To sle....

The edge of the island rears its head suddenly as the earth drops
suddenly 40 feet to the ocean below.  The pounding of the surf crashing
against the walls is thunderous.  To the south the jungle forms a neat line
as though afraid to come near the edge lest it too falls to the rocks below.

Sandy Beach~
The rolling surf crashes gently up the beautiful white beaches.  Long
expanses run across the entire length of the island like a shield against
the harshness of the sea.  The surface is perfect save for the occation
creature checking out the sea or the carcass of a large animal that may have
washed ashore, even now being fed apon by the scavengers on the island.  The
jungle comes right to the shore to the east.

The edge of the jungle~
Tall thin grasses eclipse most of the view.  Moss hangs down from immense
trees and entwines itself within the tall grasses creating a psuedo wall
around the jungle.  The earth trembles and shakes and loud baying sounds can

A path through the Jungle~
A rather large animal path seems to cut its way through the dense foliage
of the jungle.  The ground has been trampled clear through such that a find
sand path has been worn.  It is not clear what created the path but it is
obvious that it was large.  The path seems to run in an north-south route.

The edge of the jungle~
Tall thin grasses eclipse most of the view.  Moss hangs down from immense
trees and entwines itself within the tall grasses creating a psuedo wall
around the jungle.  The earth trembles and shakes and loud baying sounds can
be heard from within the wetlands.

A path through the Jungle~
A rather large animal path seems to cut its way through the dense foliage
of the jungle.  The ground has been trampled clear through such that a find
sand path has been worn.  It is not clear what created the path but it is
obvious that it was large.  The path seems to run in an north-south route.

Sandy Beach~
The rolling surf crashes gently up the beautiful white beaches.  Long
expanses run across the entire length of the island like a shield against
the harshness of the sea.  The surface is perfect save for the occation
creature checking out the sea or the carcass of a large animal that may have
washed ashore, even now being fed apon by the scavengers on the island. 
The jungle comes right to the shore to the east.

The Jungle~
Enormous trees threaten to eclipse out the sun during the day and
enshroud the jungle in pitch black darkness at night.  Grass grows in odd
patches on the ground and strange red and orange flowers provide the only
distinct colorings in the jungle.  Everything else seems to meld together.

A mountain~
A small mountain errupts at the edge of the jungle.  Large paths have
been carved into it's sides from violent lava flows in ages past.  Plants
grow sporadically, timidly trying to reclaim their place amongst the rocks. 
The slope is too steep to climb here making the only choice back to the
jungles to the north, east and west or further around the mountain.
