arlingorath~
Founded by the adventurer Yelthin Poleskia, what we now know as
Arlingorath once was a peaceful farming village placed on a fertile plot of
land located between the Eastern desert and the Southern badlands.  Two
hundred years into its existence, the village, then known as Farrindale, was
first conquered by Lord Cyesteline, the founder of Cerehnthall, the city
later to become Crysantia.  The people of Farrindale were not treated well
by their new ruler, and over the course of centuries of opression began to
seek assistance from the occult.  Belthesen Poleskia, a direct descendent of
Yelthin Poleskia, managed to contact the world of demons through a
three-month ceremony he performed somewhere in the badlands to the southeast
of Farrindale.  He persuaded the Demon Lord Arlingor to come forth into the
world of man with his hordes, and destroy the oppresors of Cerehnthall.  A
great battle was fought, ending when General Crysan destroyed Arlingor and
banished the rest of the demons back to their own world.  However,
Farrindale had been fortified into the great city of Arlingorath under the
Demon King's rule, and it would not fall again.  Cerehnthall was renamed
Crysantia in honor of the great General.  Arlingor's soul, trapped within
his helm, was hidden deep beneath the earth.  The two cities have lived in a
state of perpetual battle for millennia since the fall of Arlingor.

The Armor of Arlingor
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The armor of the demon king, including his helm, claws, his intangible fury,
as well as his cloak are buried in a sealed tomb guarded by an army of spirits.
Hidden at the end of an enormous underground labrynth, It is accessable to only
the hardiest of adventurers, and should it be found, defeating its guardians
is no easy task.  It is said the Helm, in which Arlingor's soul was trapped,
is too powerful for a mere mortal.  Should one wear it, the soul will posess and
transform the body of the hapless fool, bringing Arlingor back to life.

Scanning the pages of this old, thin book, you come upon the following:
The Legendary Dagger "Soulbane"
---------------------------------------------------------------------
A relic of the demon war, the dagger wielded by general Crysan,
Soulbane was said to have captured the soul of Arlingor, thus earning its name
A very powerful weapon, it is said to be guarded by the spirit of Crysan.
No one knows its location, but it is rumored to still be somewhere in the realm.
 
 
The Great Maul "Doombringer"
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Seraphulest is the most feared memory of the demon war after Arlingor.
Its fearsome power and untamed nature made it an incredibly destructive force.
Its power was derived from the maul crafted in the fires of the demon realm.
It is said that anyone who wields Doombringer without sufficient experience
Will succumb to the weapon's urge to be reunited with its master, and will
transform into the Seraphulest, to be unleashed upon the world again.
Currently said to be owned by the Mercenary guild, Doombringer's
location is a closely guarded secret.
 
 
Frost Song
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Helihalex was one of Arlingor's demon generals, a fearsome Ice demon.
However, he did not see eye to eye with his ruler, as he felt the plight of 
Arlingorath was not worthy of the demons' assitance.  He felt that Crysantia
was no worse than Arlingorath, and refused to take a side.  As a result
he was banished from his home in the demon's kingdom, never to return.
He is said to live deep within a cave in the mountains North of Crysantia,
surrounded by followers, wild people who worship the "Father of Frost"
His sword, Frost Song, grants protection from both good and evil to
its user, although only those who are truly objective and neutral may wield it.

This unorganized shop consists of a workbench, a number of strange

colored potions fill racks on the walls, with even more potions lying in
sorted piles towards the back of the shop.  All around is a magical energy,
as well as the scents of thousands of herbs mingling in the air.

An Intersection~
The Eastern Highway travels East and West here, but a small path diverges
from the main road, heading South.  It appears to have been worn into the
plains over time by farmers taking their goods to market in Arlingorath.

To the east looms the Black Gate of Arlingorath.  Centuries ago, the

guards the entrance to the city.  The highway continues West as well.

Outside Arlingorath~
The Black Gate towers high above, the westernmost entrance to
Arlingorath.  Members of the black watch patrol the walls, and the heads of
Arlingorath's foes sit on spikes atop the gate, a warning to all those
unwelcome visitors who may enter.

A Footpath Through the Forest~
Repeated travel more than careful planning seems to have
led this dirt path to exist. Rather than following any

hills and valleys of the land, and curves around most
obstacles. The forest looms down on all sides while the

The barley is four feet tall here, and a rich brown in color. Small
animals scurry about, safe to look for food in the well-concealed depths of
the field. The occasional bird flies overhead, casting mysterious shadows.

be felt coming from it when the wind shifts just right.

The road becomes narrower here, turning into a village street.  To the

hammer of a blacksmith can be heard, piercing through the air with every
stroke.

It is very dark in this room, which has been abandoned for quite some

shattered bits of wood cover the floor where racks have fallen off the
walls.  This shop must be thirty degrees colder than it is outside, there
almost seem to be patches of ice on the floor from place to place. 
Furthermore, a strange force eminates from an untold source lurking in the
darkest corner of the room.

shop.  In the center, a small clearing in the forest of boxes has been made,
with a small table in the center of it.  The table is surprisingly clean, in
sharp contrast to its cluttered surroundings.  Upon it lie wands of various
colors and sizes, each with a meticulously callighraphied price tag hanging
from it.

The dirt road, known to the villagers as Main Street, offers a rather
large array of merchants to choose from. The nearest of those are the
jeweller to the north, and the most of village merchants, the tavern 
to the south. From the noises emanating from the tavern doors, it is
safe to assume the locals know how to enjoy themselves.

A variety of trinkets line the shelves of this jewel shop. Some have

The Forest~
This corner of the forest is especially dark, as the thick canopy above
blocks out almost all of the sunlight.  Trees are so close together on all
sides that there is nowhere to go but north.  One tree is particularily
noticable, as it is four times larger than any other tree around.  Numerous
holes have been drilled in its trunk by insects and birds over the ages,
some almost large enough to fit through.

led this dirt path to exist. Rather than following any
sort of linear direction, this path runs along the natural
hills and valleys of the land, and curves around most
obstacles. The forest looms down on all sides while the
path seems to run in the resemblance of North and South.

The Forest~
This section of the forest has an increasing portion of evergreens,
as a result of moving further inland and higher in elevation. Also,
the animals show signs of greater reservation and distrust of
possible predators.

The Forest~
A wide array of disiduous and evergreen trees comprises the
majority of this forest. The wildlife here is surprisingly
lush and friendly. Whereas most wild animals would scatter,
these creatures seem unoffended by your presense.

The Northern Road is rather different than the East-West Highway.
In fact, this road is in such disrepair it is hard to call it a

Battlefield to be a desolate No Man's Land, control of the road
constantly shifting sides. This intersection in the road offers
a dirt path leading West into fields of Wheat.

The Secret Stash~
Huge amounts of arcane energy can be felt swirling about this room in a
vortex, seemingly funneling into a huge chest sitting in the middle of the
rom. The energy seems to take form now and then, and faces suddenly appear
every few seconds, only to vanish as quickly as they appeared.  The power
radiating from the chest is enough to keep anything from leaving this room.

A Strange Room~
This room is seemingly spherical in nature, having no flat surface
anywhere.  Gravity can still be felt, so it is possible to get footing on
what seems to be the bottom of the room.  A hole at the top of the room
provides the only light, and thin strands of some strange material dangle
from the edges of the hole all the way to the floor.  The only flaw in the
perfectly smooth finish of the wall(s?)  Of this room is a small rectangular
crack in the East side.

A Strange Chamber~
This chamber seems to be hewn out of the very heart of a mountain, its
walls smooth and polished, forming a perfect cube.  A hole in the shape of a
nine pointed star is cut through what seems to be the East wall, although
directions seem unclear in this room.

darkness.  Absolutely nothing can be seen, and there seem to be exits
leading in every direction.  On occasion a chill can be felt as something

By an Underground Stream~
Luminescent mushrooms grow all over the walls of the cave, casting a pale
greenish glow over the contents of this room.  A stream runs through the
cave, its frigid waters dark and deep as the night.  A strange glow radiates
from a finely hewn doorway to the west, although it's impossible to see what
is beyond the archway.

Standing within the entrance to arlingorath, the air of the city is thick
with evil.  Two enormous guards stand here clad in blood-red chaimail,
seemingly faceless behind their visors.  The highway stretches to the West
out of the city.  Entrances to the city walls lie to the North and South,
and a street enters the city to the East.

From the height of this tower, a youthful set of eyes would be

if the war is turned in favor of Arlingorath, the sentries here
can have the gate closed and archers put along the walls 
instantly. If something were to happen to these guards, Arlingorath
would be in position to benefit greatly.

out of oak is what faces south.  Pipes extend through the ceiling in order

The Idler's Chamber~
You have been transferred here for excessive idling.  Enter portals if
you wish, some are safe, some are not.  Or wait for an immortal to release
you.  If you are mad about this, read rule number six in Help Rules: It
follows: "Sitting around idle with a client is hazardous to your health.  If
we catch you doing it, strange things may happen to your character."  By the
way, if you use anything other than one of the four portals or an immortal's
transfer to exit this room, you will be slain, and your corpse will be
eaten.  No questions asked.

This room has 7 walls, all at perfect 128.571428 degree angles to each
other.  There is a seven-sided table in the exact center of the room, with
all sorts of strange glowing symbols hovering just above its surface.  One
of the walls is a shifting, glowing sea of blood-red energy, slowly pulsing
and rippling.

atmosphere is one of intense comcentration and competition.

This is an enormous chamber hewn out of the very bedrock of the
mountains.  Polished walls rise smoothly to a rounded ceiling, their surface
glinting with frost.  An enormous throne carved out of ice dominates the
center of the room, its stoic presence offset by a number of gaudy
decorations and trinkets filling the rest of the room.  A large sign hangs
on the wall behind the throne.

The Righteous Jolungth, lord of the Northern Frost Giants For The Extermination Of Objectivity And Apathy (NFGFTEOOA) hereby decrees:
Anything living, hear this.  If you breathe, if you can think (even if just a little bit), you are eligible!
Bring the Frost Song, the source of power for the horrible scourge of indifference led by the demon Helihalex,
to Jolungth, and he will give you his mighty sword Vinterius in return!
Just think, the very weapon wielded by The Righteous One could be yours!
Good luck, and may the gods go with you on your journies.

say I have something that may assist you, but I require a favor.
say Long ago, there was a huge battle in this realm, with millions slain on both sides.
say The demon king Arlingor wore a helm that gave him awful powers, he took the lives of many a good man during those few days.
say The righteous general Crysan led the forces of good, and Arlingor and his legions were vanquished.
say If you bring me the helm of the demon king, you will be rewarded with the very weapon Crysan used to take the soul of Arlingor.
say Return to me with the helm, and good luck.

say The Demon Arlingor is said to lurk somewhere in the realm.
say He awaits the day when someone will return his helm to him, and he can assume his true form again.
say Should you encounter him, three words and three words only will defeat him.
say They are:
say Galifraph, Tindyle, Helistrius.
say The demon will vanish upon hearing these three ancient words of power.
say You must beware, however, for if he sights you the words will not have any affect on him.
say One more thing . . . The soulbane dagger will bind itself to its user, and they will never be rid of it as long as you live.

say Well, once upon a time, before the Father of Frost built his monastery, he lived in a large cave.
say He had befriended the great white beasts that inhabitied the cave,
say and they were protecting him and feeding him while he rested.
say When he left the cave to build his new home, he left something behind.
say He protected it with powerful magic, using enchanted pieces of stone as keys to the treasure.
say No one knows where the stones are now, or what the treasure is . . .
