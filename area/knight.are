the Angel of Death~
The Angel of Death wanders about looking for souls to harvest.

A man dressed in elegant plate mail guards the path.

unholy light of the heavens. He turns towards you and speaks:

   special about the realms will allow you access to the most
   powerful of all statuettes. It is a copy of the Oracle south

Elistania, the Great Wyrm~
A massive dragon is coiled about in the void.
~
Her massive body is covered in purple scales, each razor sharp and vibrant
in their color. Two great horns curve down from her face, spiraling to 
their points inches from her eyes. Her razor sharp tooth lined maw grins
and speaks,

   "Hello there, you won't get the pretty flower, no one will."

With a cackling laugh she returns to stroking the huge blue orb in the
center of the void.

Death and devestation are the only things to describe the court. In the

engraved in gold and set high, as if in a place of honor. A grate in the
floor carries blood and entrails out of the room.
