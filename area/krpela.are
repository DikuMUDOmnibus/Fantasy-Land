Korpela Forest~
Darkened trees loom overhead blocking all sunlight from penetraing
the forest floor.  Strange noises can be heard coming from all directions,
making this forest seem quite uncomforting.  A small, barely worn path
leads northward.

Tree limbs reach out into the path, almost as if they were alive
and looking for something...  Or someone.  The howls of wolves
can be heard to the north, exactly where the path leads.  A break
in the treeline can be seen to the east.

the path leads.  It also seems to be growing darker and darker with each
passing step.

A dank fog slowly creeps along the pathway, emanating from the west. 
The only way to make out where the path leads is by the lack of trees to
the north.

Several sets of red and yellow eyes can be seen peering through the
darkness.  The obtrusive fog slowly begins to dissapate, uncovering paths
to the north and east.  The path to the north appears much safer than the
one to the east.

Not even the wind can be heard moving as the forest is overcome by an
eerie silence.  Not even the path leading east has been touched with
footprint of any kind.

from the north.  The gloomy path leads to the north.

The pungent odor of dead carcasses overwhelmes the senses.  A large
pile to the west seems to be where the odor is emanating from.  A safer,
more pleasant smelling trail leads to the north.

An opening to this dreary forest can finally be seen to the north. 
The first rays of sunshine slowly begin to descend upon the forest floor
as it slowly disperses into normalness.   A strange odor of something
rather horrific can be sensed to the east where a small little path is
seen.

Korpela Forest~
Twisted branches and thorned bushes cut across the path in a mazelike
pattern.  A small path narrows from the bushes and branches and makes to
the north where some form of life can be detected.

Before a dead end outside a cave~
Rabid animals chase each other hungrily among the dead greenery. 
Fallen trees block the path to the east.   A dark black opening to the
west reveals a small cave as the dead end is blocked by a huge mountainous
rocks here.

A quiet area~
Dead leaves and branches litter the ground, making more than enough
sound to warn whatever may be ahead.  To the north a large clearing
can be seen and to the south a dead end.

A darker realm~
The nauseating aroma of rotting flesh fills the stale air.  Flies
can be seen swarming over the carcasses strewn about the forest
floor.  The path circles the exterior of the pile before returning
to the forest.  To the northwest lies a humongous keep of some
kind.  The walls are layered in strange black stone ..  aged and
weakened.  A small path aside some trees takes you there to the
west.

dreariness disappears and is replaced with lush greenery.  Even the
critters begin to frolic and scurry about.

Lush blossoms of red and gold fill the trees, accomanied by a fresh,
fragrant smell.  Sunlight tickles the forest floor where more flowers
begin to grow and bloom.  Far into the northern distance is a large open
field.

The sun shines brightly down as trees break away into a field of
flowers.  Soft grass gathers at your feet replacing the path to the south.
Deer can be seen grazing in the distance.

Lush green grass covers the field in every direction.  Wildflowers
of all colors and varieties grow every which way, leaving a single
path northward.  Light shadows from the trees aside the path loom
across the trail.  A strange off-trail heads east where from a
distance a sudden huge castle arises from nowhere.  Funny how the
structure is so well hidden from this thick forest.

The wildflowers give way to a large stretch of grass, obviously the
grazing grounds of the deer as they can be seen to the west.   In the
northern distance a clear, blue pond can be seen.

north the field slowly starts rolling into hills

The lake here is huge and gets much more larger in size as you
take waters' spreading to the northwest where more of this water
steadily flows.

Near a lake~
The lake stretches and ends towards the west, a green hill inclines
towards that direction.  The lake then enlarges around the hill to the
west and forms a larger body of water to the north, where currents flow as
far as the eye can see.

Out on the lake atop a small walking plank~
The currents around are rather calm, however the flow of the water
seems to hover slowly up and down making you a slight bit dizzy.
The skies are in a decent condition and stretch deeper out around
with land forseeable in the south.  To the west, the body of water
thins out where beginnings of an extended riverbank veers off in
an unknown direction.  A small pier is also seen that way curving
to the north out into the sea.

A pier~
A long aged wooden pier that goes further out west curves to the
north where a large immobile ship can be seen.  Beyond the mast
lies the waters that stretch far beyond to the north.  The walkway
goes to the east into shallow waters.

Everywhere about you is water.  There is no land visible around.
The calm winds allow the surface of the water to be almost still.

Leaving the forest~
The hill slightly carries upward and straightens here northward where the
fields have now transformed into thicker greeneries.  A dirt trail carries
northward into the valleys seen afar while another trail well-made veers
eastward as a giant keep of some sort loom high above.

At the end of Korpela~
The fields of Korpela hang far beneath the plateaus down south
where the distant lands of Thoth can be seen.  To the northwest
across the plains lies the valleys where more of the undiscovered
lands lie.  A cave lies to the north where the stone walls linger
off to the northeast where the rocks layering extend further out
in that direction.

A muddy darkness~
A horrific smell is emitted terribly here as the ground is extremely
damp almost mushy to the surface.  Treading around this little
spot has made blotches of mud and other slimy substances glop about
beside a huge circular shaft that leads somewhere down.  A strange
echoish noise is heard as a bubbly goo surfaces along the openings
of the hole.  Dead shrubs are layered around here as dead plants
are furnished about.  A path leads away here to the west.
