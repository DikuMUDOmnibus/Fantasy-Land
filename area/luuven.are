Entrance to the Fields of Darke~
You have entered the fields of Darke.  To the far north you can see the huge
walls of Luuven, which is currently under attack by the orc scorchers of the
Black Plains.  The field directly north of you shows many signs of battle.
To your west and east are the camps of the orcish hordes.

Guard Post~
Immediately after you enter this guard post you get the feeling of
darkness upon you.  This heavily guarded area raises your suspicion on what
may lie ahead.  The guards are perfectly still and stare straight ahead. 
Past these guards lies a large tent, from which you can hear orc voices
coming.  To the north lies a field, the entrance to Darke is east of you.

Officer's Tent~
The feeling of darkness is almost overpowering and seems to physically enter
your body, making you feel rather uneasy and giving you the urge to run and
find safety.  In the middle of this tent is a small round table that has the
orcs' battle plans laid out on it.  From the opening to the north you can see
a dim red light and can hear some strange chanting.

Dark Lord's Tent~
As you climb in through the door of the tent an eerie mist surrounds your
body, a sour taste fills you mouth and the very scent of death is in the
air.  Looking around the tent you se two glowing red eyes staring at you and
a strange chanting noise comes to your ears.

Scorcher's Campground~
Along with the horrible reek of this camp are the Scorchers' which fight the
field battles for the orcs of the Black Plains.  The campground is very messy
and there are spears stuck in the earth with human heads on top of them.  The
ground is scattered with blood stained weapons.  East of you is a small tent.
To the south you can see a large field.

Orc Blacksmith~
As you enter this tent you feel the heat of many hot flames.  All around the
floor are scattered weapons, both finished and unmade pieces.  Although this
place is very messy to you, it is clean for an orcish tent.  As you peer around
the tent you spot a strange piece of iron that seems to be working by itself,
making a sword.  The exit is to the west.  There is an opening to a larger tent
to your east.

Orc Infantry's Tent~
Here lies the orc soldiers' tent.  As you see the green orc blood and
corpses scattered around the room you realize that these horrid creatures
even kill their own kind.  Why would they stop for you?  You should watch
your step for this place is far from being deserted.  As you walk further
into the tent you have an uncontrollable urge to vomit.  A small fire lies
in the southwest corner of the tent with a pot above it.  The only way out
is the way you came.

Darke Field Battle Ground ~
You notice as you walk in that this particular part of the field has
much more grass than the others, probably because of all the nice fertile
corpses which once laid here.  You can see the silhouettes of fighting
warriors with spears and banners in the chilling wind and morning mist. 
Lame horses lie here, whinnying for their masters which lie dead beside them
in the middle of this terrifying and horrible bloody war that will never
end.

Darke Fields Battle Ground~
The ground is a dull red color from the blood of both orcs and men.  The
faces of the dead, frozen in their last agonies, chill you even more than
the biting wind which blows through here.  Although many have already fallen,
this field is far from being a sound resting place for the dead.

Orcish Rendezvous ~
Here the orcish hordes gather like buzzards to carrion as they group to attack
Luuven.  The area emits a low growl as the orcish raiders whip their savage
mouths into a frenzy.  The earth shakes as catapults are loaded and moved into
position.  As you look in the orcs' crude eyes you can see the faint reflection
of the white walls of Luuven.

Darke Field Battle Ground~
You watch as a valiant knight goes into a large pack of Orcs, swinging his
sword high and mighty, cutting the Orcs down rapidly.  Even so, one orc
impales him with a spear; and the human falls to the ground, mortally wounded.
The orcs quickly leap upon the fallen knight, finishing him off with their
deadly spears.

Before Luuven~
The huge walls of Luuven seem to be something that you could only find in
your dreams.  You begin to think about why anyone would try to siege a city
that seems virtually impenetrable; but you are quickly interrupted by the
noises of battle nearby to the south.  To the north lie the legendary gates
of Luuven.  East and west are more fields.

Tier Guard Quarters~
These are the sleeping rooms of the Tier's guard.  The room has many beds
that look as if they have not been slept in for days.  On the walls of the
room you can see many flags representing the many guards of the city.  On
the side of the room is a small window through which you can see the vast
army of the Horde preparing to attack the city.

Courtyard of the Fourth Tier~
This courtyard is a playground for the children of the city.  The green
grass is plentiful and a small box of sand is in the middle of the
courtyard.  This yard seems to be the only place where the children of the
city can find themselves feeling safe away from the danger outside the city.
Up is to the Courtyard of the Fifth Tier.

Glass Shop~
Magical glassware and scrolls lie about this room.  Covering the desktop
you notice a relatively long scroll that the wizard is studying.  Could this
perhaps be the scroll of the secrets of the one ring?  While the wizard is
studying, his initiate will be glad to serve you.  You can feel heat coming
from under the door to the south .  The courtyard is to the west.

Foundry~
Heat and fire make you sweat heavily in this room.  The melters here are
the main action in making the magic items for the glass shop and the gold
and silver for the gold shop .  You think to yourself that you have been
here long enough, and you really want to leave because of all the heat. 
North is the glass shop and west is the House of Gold and Silver.

Bakery of Luuven~
As you inhale the smell of fresh bread your senses make you want to stop
everything you are doing to eat bread.  The room is in perfect order and the
baker here seems to be a master at his profession for there is no excess
powder on the counters or on the floor and he is in the process of making
some more bread.  Residences are west and east while the courtyard is to the
south.

Residence~
You aren a large house that is used to shelter the citizens of the city. 
The room is filled with beds and sleeping bags .  Although this house is
very large, it is still only one room big.  The kitchen, living room, and
sleeping areas are all in this large room.  You can see during this hard
time the way these citizens have to go through so bad stuff.  It seems that
this is the worst it could get for the people of Luuven, but they think
differently.  Although crowded they feel fine here for this is one of the
safest areas in all of the city.  The bakery is to the east.

Residence~
Many people who are fleeing from the presence of the horde outside the
city are living here.  Being in one of the safest places in the city you
feel somewhat safer than you do ouside in the open courtyards.  The large
room is filled with hundreds of children, parents, and babies.  Noticing
that many guards are here waiting to protect the people if necessary, you
stand at a distance and are careful about where to fight.  The bakery is to
the west.

This courtyard is totally covered with grass, excluding the gravel
walkways which cut through the green grass.  Every now and then you can see
a person hurry through the courtyard, but other than that it is fairly
empty.

Guest Quarters~
The room is very small, but also cozy.  There are ten beds and the guests
here seem to be happy and relaxed.  You think it strange that many people of
this time are not feeling the fear that you thought they might be receiving.
You notice that this room is next to the servant's chamber and that the
guests must be highly regarded people in this city .  Exit to the courtyard
is to the east.

Servants are taking a rest from all of their daily activies here.  The
room is fairly clean and each servant gets to have their own bed and
bathtub.  It seems to you that even the lowest class of people in this city
get treated with the luxury of a high class inn.  The walls on the room are
of a pure and pleasant light which magnifies when the sun shines upon it.

Guard Room of the Upper Tiers~
The room is much more fancy than the Guard Room of the Lower Tier.  There
are medallions and many medals showing the quality of this great guard team.
While you are studying the great achievements of the guard, you hear a loud
bang.  The assault on Luuven has begun.  At the same moment you also
hear several horns; and many of the guards here begin to run down to the
lower tiers.  Only a few remain.  Rooms that house statues of the king are
east and west.

Statue of King Raylun ~
The statue here is of the King Raylun.  King Raylun was king in the time
when a huge plague wiped across the land.  King Raylun moved the Luuven, 
from the plains into this mountain pass.  The age after which he made that
move is called "The Golden Age."  Luuven thrived during this time and King
Raylun made it all possible.  Standing enchanted by this statue your thoughts
are broken as you hear a low rumble.

Statue of King Ostoher ~
The statue here is of the great King Ostoher.  This is the king who built
the first main wall of the city.  It was designed to give the defenders of
the wall a tactical chance in fighting.  He also began the work of the great
outer wall when the orcs first moved to the plains. Today many hope that the
walls that this great King built will hold up to its intention.

The brilliant white walls of this hall are breathtaking.  On the sixth
tier you notice that the guards here are far more decorated then the guards
below .  While you gaze around this amaxing hall you notice a sign to the
east which reads: "Teribrel the Catcher", who is the only rat catcher in all
of Luuven.  A dining hall is to the north and to the east are the
Steward family's living quarters.

Town Council Meeting Room~
The room is like a long hallway with a slim table running through it.  A
couple of chosen council members are here discussing the evacuation plan if
the walls of Luuven do fall.  With all of the room almost empty, a cold chill
runs through your body.  You know that in this room, the worst is always
expected to happen.  The courtyard is to the east.

Teribrel the Catcher's Home~
The room is filled with many of the catcher's prizes, rats.  Looking at
the quality and the rats which hang on the wall as trophies, you wonder how
in the hell this person was placed on the sixth tier of the city.  The items
which you see in this room make you curious about what this person does with
his spare time when not killing rats.  In the middle of the room is a small
wooden round table.  On the table you can see some fancy looking devices. 
West is the only exit.

white light peeking out of the cracks, your suspicion of the box is very
high.  The only exit is the way you entered.

one and a half feet deep.  The hand wash here is also very remarkable,
turned on by simply turning a handle back and forth.  Seeing these

advancements.  While on this tower you feel a strange presence. As you
look in the shadows you can faintly see four white eyes...

dark stone; and the only light source is from a simple lamp hung from the
roof.  The only other furnishing is a small stool that may be moved around
the pedestal upon which the stone rests.
