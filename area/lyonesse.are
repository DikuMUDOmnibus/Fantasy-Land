piskie~
A piskie~
A tiny person is hiding behind a blade of grass.
~
A man no bigger than a mouse stares up as you tower over him.  Gray hair
peeps out from under a red cap.  His eyes are as bright and unwinking as a
robin's, making his wrinkled face appear to be sterner than it would
normally.  He is clothed with white weskits, green stockings, a brown
overcoat and tan breeches.  His shoes are buckled with diamond dew drops.

{m+{x In olden days, Cornish country people, living on the Coast of Great Britain,  {m+{x
{m+{x          believed that they shared their lovely land with another, more       {m+{x
{m+{x    elusive population of piskies.  The Cornish piskie, of course is legend.   {m+{x
{m+{x     Whatever their origins, the piskies - or Piskey as he is called, for he   {m+{x
{m+{x usually works alone - are as good a people as they are mischievious, helping  {m+{x
{m+{x     the aged and infirm in their household tasks, threshing the corn on a     {m+{x
{m+{x   moonlit night, plaiting the pony's mane for stirrups and riding it wildly   {m+{x
{m+{x      the night through.  And of course, many people were piskey-led when      {m+{x
{m+{x   benighted, losing all sense of time and place and wandering helplessly in   {m+{x
{m+{x    what appeared to be a strange landscape, until they dropped down into an   {m+{x
{m+{x    exhausted sleep.  Always lively, when they chattered, they filled the air  {m+{x
{m+{x  with a sound like the droning of bees.  They were accustomed to riding upon  {m+{x
{m+{x                             the shells of snails.                             {m+{x

A huge giant~
A huge giant towers above the trees.

The giant stands here looking haughty in his tattered clothes, that he long ago grew
out of.  The pants are torn at the knees, the shirt barely covers his massive chest.
Afraid of none, he stands here smirking.

Bolster the Giant~
Bolster the Giant~
Bolster the Giant is here mourning for the love of St. Agnes.
~
Bolster is perhaps one of the biggest giants around.  He has long tangled
hair, and he can be smelled for miles and miles.  He is dressed in brown
tattered rags, appearance isn't a must for him, as he only cares for one
person in the whole world, and that is St.  Agnes, who has absolutely no
interest in him whatsoever.  
 
{m+{b================================={mH{b={mI{b={mS{b={mT{b={mO{b={mR{b={mY{b================================={m+{x
{m+{x    Bolster, it is said, had a stride that spanned six miles.  He was a bad    {m+{x 
{m+{x    tempered man, who terrorized the countryside.  He fell in love with the    {m+{x
{m+{x   beautiful St.  Agnes.  It is said that Agnes asked him to prove his love    {m+{x
{m+{x   for her by filling up a hole in the cliff at Chapel Porth with his own      {m+{x
{m+{x    blood, knowing the hole was bottomless.  Even today, the sea at Chapel     {m+{x
{m+{x                     Porth is stained red with his blood.                      {m+{x

The town is bustling with activity.  Church bells toll at all times of day
or night: Lyonesse is also known for being the "Town of One Hundred and
Sixty Churches".  No one knows for sure if this is really true, but there
sure are a lot of churches around.

The Town of Lyonesse is bustling with activity, busy yet quiet at the

seems a bit subdued and voices are hushed for the most part.  The only real
sound is the ringing of the church bells and the workers going about their
every day tasks.

A small church~
This is a small, clean church.  The walls have been freshly painted and
is still drying in some spots.  Five rows of pews are in the center of the
building providing a place of worship for those of this faith.  There are
small religious symbols on the walls and during the day, the sun creates a
rainbow of colors when it shines through the stained glass windows.

Carleon Street~
The Town of Lyonesse is bustling with activity, busy yet quiet at the
same time.  Perhaps it is because of the piousness of the people.  Laughter
seems a bit subdued and voices are hushed for the most part.  The only real
sound is the ringing of the church bells and the workers going about their
every day tasks.

The path to the Castle is paved in pure gold offset with ebon stones, the

thoroughfare, flip crisply in the wind, creating an almost rhythmic sound. 
The Castle lies to the east.  The tall ebon and gold gates sparkly brightly.

The small forest is inhabited with many kinds of wildlife that peer
around through the grass, bushes, and even up in the tall trees.  History
has it that Mount's Bay is a magical island.  Some even say that it is the
home of the famous Avalon, birthland of Merlin and home to the Lady of the
Lake.  The trees loom large reaching towards the skies, branches thick with
age.  A purplish moss grows on the treetrunks, glowing magically.

A beautiful crystalline lake extends as far as the eye
can see, a small river leads into it, fed from the seas.
he water is surprisingly fresh and drinkable.  Fish in
multitudes of colors swim about playfully.  The lake 
has a unexplainable mystic aura about it, almost like a
peaceful feeling.

A Secret Chamber~
A cave made out of pure granite sits under the lake.  It is sparsely, but
well furnished.  The walls have been worn down to a smooth surface and glow
with a pale blue aura.  Upon closer inspection, small runes are drawn into
the wall, almost undecipherable, yet it is apparent that they tell the story
of an empire.

The path to the Castle is paved in pure gold offset with ebon stones, the
colors of Lyonesse.  Banners, bearing the crest of Lyonesse line the
thoroughfare, flip crisply in the wind, creating an almost rhythmic sound. 
The Castle lies to the east.  The tall ebon and gold gates sparkly brightly.

The Castle Gates~
The tall ebon gates are encrusted with gold and jewels, showing off the
prosperity of Lyonesse.  Fierce lions are sculpted into the bars, crouched
and ready to pounce, creating a slight-of-the-eye to the passersby, and also
enforcing the fact that the castle is well guarded.  The ebon and gold
castle lies to the north and the way back into town is to the south.

like.  The crest of the city, a golden lion on a diamond shaped shield of
ebon is on each wall.  The castle continues to the north, while the castle

The walls are barely visible as they are covered almost side to side with

maps represent allies and foes.  A large planning table is covered with yet
more maps.  Large chairs surround the table.  The only exit is back to the

The Kitchens~
The kitchens are surprisingly tidy and well kept.  Neat stacks of
foodstuffs are lined up in the corners.  A huge pot of Lyonessian chowder is
boiling in the fireplace, ready for anyone who might be hungry.  Fresh bread
and pies are on the counters cooling.  The only exit is back to the west.

The Royal Treasury~
The Treasury is surprisingly devoid of money!  Or rather it's so well
concealed only the treasurer and king know how to access it.  This is for
the best, as they both have to input a secret code to even open the
concealed vault.

The Chambers of Prince Tristram~
The chambers of the Prince are stately, yet almost simplistic in it's
elegance.  Large bound journals tell the tales and adventures that Tristram
has had over the years.  A particularly large journal tells the story of his
love of Isolde, the fair maiden who has stolen his heart.  The bed is large
and covered with ebon sheets and a multitude of golden pillows.  The only
exit is back out to the west.

The chamber is very sparse.  A large armoire stands in one corner of the
room, serving as the room's only decoration.  A small narrow bed lies
directly under a small shuttered window.  Gouvernail, the occupant of the
room, is a man of little needs and few pleasures.  His life's goal is to
serve the Queen.

The Chambers of the King and Queen~
These are the private chambers of King Meliadus and Queen Isabella. 
Their heir is Tristram, the fabled Prince of Lyonesse.  The chambers are
literally fit for royalty.  Gold silken curtains cover the windows, yet
allow sunlight to shine through them during the day.  The large bed is
covered in silken ebon sheets, coinciding with the colors of Lyonesse.
