{rThis town was once bustling; however, due to some unseen forces, events, it
is now all but abandoned save a few wretched souls.  Though the town looks familiar
to those who have been here before, there are subtle nuances that make it quite
different.  Some inconvenient.  Some lethal.  It is best to be fully prepared
and ready for surprises and shocks.  Happy Hunting!  {x

The Bar~
A long mahogany bar is set in the back of the pub.  Mugs line a shelf
behind the bar.  Bottles of strong, nasty looking liquids decorate one
of the lower shelves.  A large cask rests on a table behind the bar.  A
strong but friendly looking bartender stands next to the cask polishing
glasses.  A couple of the bar maids stand in a corner and throw the most
inviting glances your way.

The Inn~
You are standing upstairs from Andy's Pub at Andy's Inn.  A few chairs
and a couple of end tables give the room a `homey' atmosphere.  A large
stone fireplace burns brightly against one wall and warms the room.  A
large oak desk is nestled in one corner of the room.  A small man with
wire-framed glasses sits behind the desk working dilligently on his books.
He looks up as you enter the room.  He looks at you quizzically.  He is
probably waiting for you to ask him for a room.

and most of the walls are covered by ancient wall paintings picturing gods,
giants and peasants.  A small doorway leads to the west.  Large steps lead
down through the grand temple gate, descending the huge mound upon which
the temple is built and ends on the temple square below.  Equally large steps
lead up through a small door into the New Midgaard Training Area.

The Temple of Eriana~
A huge obsidian altar spans the breadth of the room.  Atop the altar are
corpses in various stages of decay.  The floors are slick with blood, the
ceiling dripping with blood.  A huge apparition of Eriana, Goddess of Darkness,
hovers menacingly over the altar, grinning in deep satisfaction.  The stench
of evil and death repulse all but the most evil.  There is a gurgling puddle
on the ground emanating a faint glow.  Upon closer inspection, one can plainly
see it is the life giving blood of Eriana  There is no safety at the temple,
only death and destruction.

stretches from one end of the room to the other.  The shelves are

The Altar of Healing~
A huge white marble altar rests upon the dais.  Directly behind the altar
is a ten foot statue of Artema, the God of light.  Despite the general
dreariness of the rest of the town, the Temple of healing is fantastically
adorned, sparing no details or expense.  The walls shimmer magnificently
as the light from heaven above shines down upon the temple.  Behind the
altar, is an atrium filled with exotic plants and animals.  A veritable
utopia.  A permanent rainbow graces the atrium.  Though a temple, it does
not offer sanctuary to the evils outside.
