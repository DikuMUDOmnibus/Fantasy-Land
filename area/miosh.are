On the Sea~
The waves splash about you, threatening to pull you under for the final
time.  Floating about on the surface of the ocean has made you sick.  Your
head aches, the sun beats down relentlessly.  A drink of cool water would
taste good right about now.  Just to the north there is a part of the ocean
surface that boils and writhes.  With horror you realize you are being drawn
toward it, slowly but surely.  There is no hope of escape.  Time to die.

The Whirlpool~
The whirlpool swirls slowly at first, giving you a false sense of hope. 
Perhaps if you paddle desperately you could get out.  Thoughts of escape are
dashed quickly.  Horror fills you as the whirlpool sucks everything into it.
Icy water begins to fill your lungs as a final scream bursts free of your
lips!!!!!!

Inside the Whirlpool~
Icy water encompasses your body.  Death is only moments away, of that you
are certain.  A deafening pulse pounds inside your head.  Now would be the
time to repent if ever there was one!!

Beneath the Whirlpool~
The whirlpool swirls above you, sucking everything under that falls into
its grasp.  The light of day is barely visibile, muted as it is through the
water's surface.  A strange sense of peace fills you.  This must be how
death feels you think to yourself.  Maybe it isn't so bad after all?

Approaching the watery whirlpool~
