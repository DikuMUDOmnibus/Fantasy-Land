The Undead Hallway~
The hallway smells of putrid death and decay. You find it hard to
Breathe in the smoggy air. The room to the north houses the Vampire.
The room to the south houses the Death Knight. The hallway continues to
east and west.

The entrance to the Grand Hallway~
You stand in a marble hallway.  The walls, covered with magnificiant red
wallpapper, reach high above your head.  The ceiling, wich is arched,
contains a constant mural of days gone past, of wars , exploration, and
famine behind you stands the elevator that brought you up to this level. 
Infront of you stands a massive statue of a knight, in all his splendid
glory.  Past the knight you can see farther down in to the hallway.  The
walls lined with doors, becon for you to come and explore their contents

The Grand Hallway~
As you walk down this hallway, a sudden chill runns down your spine.  You
turn around and look behind you but nothing can be seen except for more
hallway.  The walls here are covered in brilliant red wallpaper, and the
ground, white marble.  To either side of you there are exits to exhibits. 
One labled Orcs and the other Peseants.

The Grand Hallway~
This room, very similar to the other rooms of the hallway, is wall to
wall in red wall paper, and flored with marble.  The only visable difference
is that this room has a pedistal sitting in the center of it.  On the
pedistal there is a sign that reads "Please Excuse the Odor.  Due to the
fact that most of our sculptures are as lifelike as we can get them, we
sprinkle them with their Natural odor."  On either side of you there are
doors going to exhibits.  One labled Goblins and the other Squires.

The Grand Hallway~
This, like all the other rooms, is part of a vast hallway.  Candles line
the walls immuminating every nook, every cranny.  Although these candles
provide light, you still feel there is a darkness immiting from one of the
two doors that branch off of this room.  One Door is labled Dark Elves, and
the other Wood Elves.

The Grand Hallway~
This Room is quite odd.  Instead of the normal red wall paper and marble
floors, the walls are all polished granite.  The floors, a different shade
of granite are inlayed with a dark green rock that is slightly transparent. 
The inlay is actually a picture of a massive mountian with various doors and
exits.  There is a door to either side of you, one labled Dark Dwarves, the
other Light Dwarves.

The Grand Hallway~
As you walk through this room you decide that something is following you.
You cant quite decide what, but you know its hostile.  Your eyes dart around
from corner to corner never catching a glimpse of the mysterious follower. 
Again, you turn around only too see the previous room looming behind you. 
You shrug off any feeling of fear and walk on.  To either side of you there
are doors, one labled Ogers, the other labled Knights.

The Grand Hallway~
As you walk in to this room you feel a calm fall over you.  This room
seems to kept well in order, all of the marble polished to perfection, the
walls dusted frequently.  To either side of you there are grand archways
leading to two different exhibits.  One labled the Grand Knight, and the
other labled The Ogre Mage

The Grand Hallway~
This room wreaks of garlic and other unescribeable odors.  Faint
chantings of intancations in a mysterious language float in to the room. 
The room itself is not noticeably different than that of the last polished
floors, grand archways, and that same feeling of peace. To either side of you
there are large doorways one labled White Mage and the other labled Black
Mage

You still smell the odd odors wafting in from the room before this one. 
The room is also very similar to that of the previous, polished marble
floors, and deep red wallpaper.  To the north is a solid oak door that will
stop virtually anything, it seems to be glowing with some sort of magic.  In
the center of the door there is a solid gold latch with a large key hole in
it.  Perhaps you should get a key?

The end of the Grad Hallway~
This room seems to split right down the center.  On one side, everything
is made of the blackest of black marble.  On the other, everything is made
of the purest white marble.  Either side is an exact mirror of the other,
everything placed exactly the same.  This room is quite magnifcigant.  On
the white half of the room, the door and all of the decorations are made of
polished gold.  On the black half, everything is made of the purest
platinum.
