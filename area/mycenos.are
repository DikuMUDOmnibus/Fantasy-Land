The Mycenos Master Tavern~
There is a small fireplace here, just enough to heat the musician that
sits on a stool near it.  With a harp on his lap, he entertains you as odors
of breweries from old barrels perch along the walls atop high aging wooden
shelves.  Many portraits of famous folks in Aadaria hang as the wooden floor
creaks with every step set upon this tavern.

Courtyard to the Mycenen Tavern~
You are standing in a small courtyard.  There is a small garden off on
your north, with beautiful flowers.  You can smell the good food and hear
the music coming from the tavern to your east.  To the west you can hear the
bustle of merchants selling their goods on a market day.  On your south lies
the Mycenen Bank while a group of clerics can be seen coming in and out of a
temple to the north.

The Bank of Mycenos~
This is a cool room you feel a steady breeze coming from the windows
placed in the top corners of the room.  You hear the clinking of change as
money is counted and then recounted. You notice the room is kept impeccably
clean and very neat.  Everything seems to be running smoothly and orderly,
no wonder the greatest heros' in the realms use this place for their bank. 
The hard marble floors reflect the sun and the business-like atmosphere
makes you feel you can trust these people with your money.

The Mycenos Market Square~
This is the Market Square of Mycenos were traders and merchants meet to
exchange and sell goods.  People of all races walk around here looking and
talking about events and stories of the realms.  This not just a place to
exchange goods, it is to exchange information and ideas.  The road curves
around a large fountain in the center of the square.  The roads branch off
in all directions taking you to the shops and stores of the town.
A trio of large statues are set up in a triangle, glowing with magical power.

The Mage's Laboratory~
This is the Magical Experiments Laboratory.  Dark smoke-stained stones
arch over numerous huge oaken tables, most of these cluttered with strange-
looking pipes and flasks.  The floor is covered with half-erased pentagrams
and even weirder symbols, and a blackboard in a dark corner has only been
partially cleaned, some painful-looking letters faintly visible.  A well in
the middle of the floor leads down into darkness.  Vile smells waft from the
depths.

The Dirty Alley~
You find yourself in the slummy areas of the alley.  Not much visible but
alot of sanitation and litter.  The streets of Mycenos were at one point the
most beautiful streets to be but as conditions seem much below standards,
the odor around these areas emit a rather foul scent about here.

You arrive at the common square of Mycenos where traffic is few, but
still enough activity around for things to be done.  A small fountain lies
in the middle of here where the street heads east to the Market Square.  A
tall structure with six strange pillars can be seen to the west where some
sort of activity can be heard.  To the south the street stretches further
where more exploration can be done.  A small alleyway heads north where it
makes a dead end from a distance.

the courtyard.  You can make out writings on the huge pillars marking the
entrance.  The north ends abruptly to find no way further but back to the
alley southwards.  The stench of this alley emits a foul smell perfect for
those living as beggars and bums.  A large sewer hole leading down takes you
somewhere..  Maybe you should check it out.

There is a large fire place off to one side here, sending off huge
amounts of heat and light, enough to light the whole room.  The fireplace
can't contain all of the smoke, so some leaks out into the room and makes
your eyes tear slightly.  You can also smell some brimstone and hemlock, but
only a little bit of the poisonous hemlock.

The Mycenan Morgue~
{!  It takes a moment for your eyes to adjust to the total lack of light
in this place.  When they finally do adjust, you find yourself surrounded by
horrifyingly dead bodies.  They lie all around you on their beds of stone. 
Some have obviously been here longer than others, as they are much decayed. 
You realize to your horror that you are in the catacombs, discarded with the
other dead.  Glancing around, you search the floor for your belongings,
finding them strewn about like rubbish.

As you enter here your senses are bombarded by the sweet smells of cedar
and a fireplace that is burning hickory.  The fire provides the only light
here, and a small bush is set close to it.  You recognize the bush as being
a rare witchwood bush, the most magical of hardwoods.

dressed in jet black.  He turns at your approach and smiles broadly, showing
a row of sharp teeth.  Quietly you are motioned to sit down while this
vampire finishes writing whatever he is writing.  The only obvious exit is

Entrance to the Telepath's Guild~
You stand in a simple entryway to what sounds like a quite popular cafe. 
The cafe itself is south, and you have heard tell of a magical room
called the Hall of Minds that stands beside the cafe.  A man there is known
to have mystical powers.

The Guild of the Telepaths~
You stand in awe of this place.  You can almost feel the power of mind in
this room.  It is here that you can come to be trained in new skills and to
tune up your abilities in old skills.  The ceilings are high, and the
lighting is just bright enough to allow you to see.  It is a perfect
atmosphere in which to meditate.

You stand on the outskirts of a large city - Mycenos; the capital of this
land.  The road leads north into the peace and quiet - and dangers - of the
forest; and to the south it becomes the main street of the town; surrounded
by a confusion of shops, bars, and market places.
