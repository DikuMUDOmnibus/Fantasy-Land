pot.  Dark shadows dance from the pointed shafts of the fence. You shudder
at the trail of blood leading to the front door. The hut has been known
to gallop about whirling this way and that way so that the victims can
never escape. Eerie cackling noises just about chill your blood.

it has a haunting sorrowful air which outweighs its pristine lovliness.
In the fields you can see the vegetables frozen on the vine alongside
iced over withered stalks of grains and flanked by trees whose chilled
barren fruits bespeak famine and hardship for those who live here. The
cold wind carries heart-rending sobs to your ears.  You can barely make
out the distant figure of the great goddess Demeter as she mourns the loss
of her daughter Persephone.

continuing upwards for about 40 meters.  The apex of the pyramid supports
a square tiered artifact and someone has gone to a lot of trouble to layer
bands of turquoise which alternate with the golden sandstone. A radiant
diffused beam of shimmering golden-white light dances about the artifact.
Large tropical birds of emerald green and cobalt blue are perched on some

they stare coyly at you. On second glance, not so good, they all seem to

her beautiful luminous face which is nestled within the round moon sphere
and gilded with a silvery moon crescent to the right.  You notice some

The Path to the Dead~
The great god Anubis waits here to guide souls to judgment along this path.
He oversees the weighing of the mortal heart so that only the corpses of
the unjust are given to the Eater of the Dead. Strange alien hieroglyphics
coalesce, dissolve and reform again in the swirling dark blue mists. It
is said that this very path leads to the great god Osiris who sits upon
the throne of Judgment. A pair of golden scales are carefully stacked
close to Anubis and he waves a green palm frond in one hand.

Lotus in Hand~
Peach trees bloom in pastel profusion in this peaceful area with jade green
hill-cliffs in the background.  Two snowy-white hares cavort around a small
turqoise meditation pond topped with emerald green lily pads and light pink
blossoms.  A flock of pure white geese fly overhead soaring through the
azure skies. A pale thin sugar-white crescent moon has risen over the
horizon.  Kuan Yin often comes here to listen to the weeping world and
offer enlightment to those who listen.

Dancing Path of Genders~
Magical pale green snow-roses as well as golden and delft striped crocus
bloom right up through patches of snow alongside the path.  Small pools of
hot springs bubble up through the ground. The path is one of pearly white
pebbles edged with jet black smooth rounded stones.  Evergreen needles
brush up against bare tree branches. Soft grey doves bill and coo amongst
the tree tops side by side with fierce looking falcons.  The path beckons
you onward.

heavily off of arched green branches.  Here the snow is lightly frosted
in lace-like patterns over the greenery.  Tiny golden arrows are scattered
over the landscape. The path is one of pearly white pebbles edged with jet
black smooth rounded stones. Soft grey doves bill and coo amongst the tree
tops.  The path beckons you onward.

Erebus the Underworld Abode~
This is the outermost reach of the Underworld ruled by Hades and his lovely
wife Persephone.  Having eaten some seeds from a pomegranate fruit,
Persephone must split her time between between her mother's sunny fields in
Spring and Summer and her husband's shadowy realms in Fall and Winter.
They are cradled in a sort of blue-grey pit whose walls are set with many
outcropping smooth shale rocks.  Persephone is even now preparing to take
flight to the sunny fields.

Outside the Lovers Cave~
The sky here is a deeper blue with shrouded white masses of clouds obscuring
the sun.  On a rise to one side is a clump of white birch tree. You notice
a pair of lovers strolling cautiously as they get some fresh air. Legend
has it that they are eluding the vengeful old King of the army known as
the Fiana.  The man wears a leaf green shirt and has an earthen brown cloak
draped round his shoulders secured by a round silver brooch inlaid with
onyx and gold.  The lass wears a wreath of white flowers and has gently
laid one hand on his back.  Even as you spot a cave opening to the west,
you hear the chilling sound of a hound baying.

Lovers Cave~
Though the cave is darkened you feel a magical sense of safety here.
You see neat piles of clothing and a bed of sorts made from evergreen
branches that are covered with a comforter. Even the baying sounds of the
hounds seems dimmer though you shiver slightly with the foreboding
that Diarmuid will die protecting his lover, Grainne, from the aged King
of the Fiana, Finn.  Legend has it that Finn was eventually deserted by his
army for continuing to hunt down the lovers. After Dairmuid's death, Grainne
lives on for a time but eventually perishes of grief and is buried by him.

The Slopes of Mount Abu~
A great fissure in the earth has opened up near the slopes of Mount Abu.
Into it fell the Cosmic Cow, Kama-duh, whose milking yields whatever you
wish.  Saraswati, as a great river, has flowed into the crevasse, floating
the cow to the surface and thus saving her. The blue-green waters of the
river are gilded over with silvery ripples.

Saraswati and Brahma, a most dignified and lovely couple, are meditating
here. Above the silvery gilded blue-green waters of the river, Brahma
lithely reposes on an enormous yet very graceful white swan who magically
hovers in that one spot. The gracious goddess is lightly reclining upon
the fluid surface as if it was a satin lounging couch. Golden ribbons
are woven through her flowing deep purple hair. A few fragrant ivory
lotus blossoms break the surface of the river.

The Valkyrian Bier~
It is on this cliff that the Hero Sigurd spied a beautiful young woman who
was asleep and fell in love with her immediately. Wakened by his presence,
Brynhild arose full of wonder and foretold his arrival even describing
the bane or heart he was holding after having vanquished the cruel and
fearsome dragon Fafnir.  This very bane had set her free from Odin's
Thorn of Sleep given her as a punishment for her actions which had
displeased and caused him to vanquish her from his Valkyrian maidens.

The packed earth walls seem secure and the air has an earthy fragrance to
it.  Most of the footprints you see are coyote paws.  The wily one must
chortle to himself when he hides his treasure here.  You notice that the
bottom slopes downwards with a mound of dirt at the far end.
