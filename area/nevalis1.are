Along a Path~
{cThe path looks like it has ben worn out, as if it had been here
for some time.  Oddly enough, word about this village came about recently. 
It seems that after centuries of seclusion, the village in the distance has
decided to be seen by all who venture there.  The tranquil forest that
surrounds it waves gently to passing adventurers, but is it a greeting or a
goodbye?  {x

Before a Strange Village~
{cFrom outside the fence, the village seems to be busy with citizens
moving to and from homes and shops, performing their daily chores. 
Amidst all the surrounding the forest, the sun has managed to penetrate
through the canopy, providing an ample amount of light to grow produce. 
The village seems typical of villages, but things are often not as they appear.{x.

Village Entrance~

and roofed by a blanked of tightly wrapped leaves.  The villagers seem to
be in a daze as if they cannot be detered from their duties.  A strange
essence can be detected here that the people here are unaware of.  It may be
the cause of the appearance and even the source of this very village.  {x

Dirt Beaten Road~

on either side of the road made by carts and carriges.  The dirt is very
loose, yet it never seems to be swept into the air whenever someone passes
over it.  Simple but complex buildings take residence along the northern
section of the road.  The buildings look almost imaginary, as such grand

A small lantern flickers on the wall, making the golden thread shimmer in
the darkness.  Other than the designs nothing else in this room can be seen.

to this place.  Great explosions are seen as energy collides in this chaotic
alternate universe.  Through all the confusion, a small hole below reveals
the land from which this realm lurks over.  However, several other warps are
swirling here, containing mysteries and possibly treasures.  Each path has
its own benefits as well as consequences.  {x

plants that are as tall as trees, containing leaves that are over six feet

{DA Dead End{x~
{rThe rumble of a road has led to a dead end.  All that lies here is a
giant pile of garbage, which seems to act as a blockade.  In most likely
hood, there is probably a reason why this pile was constructed here.  Oddly
enough, the debris and garbage from the ground move themselves to the pile. 
Perhaps it is just the wind, or it could be something unknown which drives
objects to this crude construction.  {x

{DTower Ruins{x~
{rThis appears to be the ruins of an important building that once stood
tall.  Research papers and shattered glass are strewn about the floor while
a strong wind howls through the hole in the ceiling.  A small light pulsates
randomly on a broken down teleporter.  It may well be functional, however,
the destination of the teleporter may lead to a dangerous location.  {x

{DBehind A Pile of Garbage{x~
{rThe teleporter has stopped behind one of the gigantic piles of garbage
and debris.  A strange force can be detected here.  It seems to block the
use of acrane powers in this room.  The clouds swirl directly overhead,
while a mysterious figure can be seen further east.  {x

{DA Strange Energy Field{x~
{rHere stands an amorphous shadow that can shift into any form it
pleases.  From the looks of it's powerful aura, it probably possesses many
magical abilities.  It seems to warp and distort the enviroment around it,
and is probably the cause of all the trouble in this area.  The form grins
evilly as it clenches its shapeless fist which causes all exits to
disappear.  The only way out now seems to be slaying this foul demon. 
However, this being is a master of illusions and may very well have just
concealed the exits but not actually remove them.  {x
