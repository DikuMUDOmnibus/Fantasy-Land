Chameleon is the wife of Bink.  She looks different each day, her
appearance changing with the lunar cycle from extraordinary beauty to
downright ugly, her intelligence ranging inversely from incredibly stupid to
amazingly bright.  Right now she is in her pretty-stupid phase, so while she
encites lust in the male population of the North Village, she is also as

Outside the East Gate of the North Village~
You are outside the east gate of North Village.  The North Village is the
largest village in Xanth, and is the center of most of the human population.
The old Storm King once reigned supreme from the village, but since then,
King Trent has gained rulership and has moved to Castle Roogna, far to the
southeast.  To the east lies the enchanted path, where all wanderers may
travel in peace so long as they follow the path.

You have reached the forests of Xanth.  There is an enchanted path to the
north, where safety from the creatures of Xanth may be found.  The
protection of the path does not extend here, however.  The gloom of the
forests surrounds you with a dark mist, and strange sounds can be heard to
the south.  There is a peaceful glade to the east, full of pine trees.

The Peace Pines~
You are in a peaceful glade filled with large pine trees and plants.  You
feel utterly at peace here and begin to feel rather sleepy.  Laying down in
the lush forest ground, you begin to drift asleep.  Then you notice a
skeleton lying in the grass next to you.  Apparantly, this is not a good
place to rest.  However, as you begin to struggle, the full force of the
peace pines' self-defense magic kicks in, making you too drowsy to stand. 
You fall to your knees, and then to the floor.  Eternal sleep has claimed
you.

obscured by the weather and impossible to track.  The safety of the
enchanted path is not too far to the north, and the forest continues into
the south.

The Wilderness of Xanth~
You are in the wild forests of northern Xanth.  Strange sounds rustle in
the crowded vegatation that fill this forest.  A number of trees here seem
almost to loom closer to you, as if they too, wish to consume you.  This is
not a good place to picnic.

The Wilderness of Xanth~
You are exploring the wilderness of northern Xanth.  All sorts of
predatory animals, as well as plants, lurk about here, waiting for you to
make a mistake.  Glowing red eyes watch you from the darkness that envelops
the forest and eerie sounds echo from the depths.  You had best move on.

The Lion Ants' Den~
You are inside a small dark cave, filled with the sounds of hungry lion
ants.  A number of bones are scattered about the floor, the remains of those
that had intruded upon this den before.  The cave extends south from here
and the way out is to the east.

The Lion Ants' Den~
You are deep inside the lion ants' den.  Large piles of bones gnawed
clean lie everywhere, and the very walls here are splashed with dried blood.
The echo of the roars of the lion ants is loud in your ears, making you
flinch with every new sound.  The way out lies to the north, and perhaps you
should run for safety while you still can.

The Wilderness of Xanth~

and dense vegetation make scouting about a challenge.  Every step you take

The Crabapple Orchard~
You are in a small grove filled with crabapple trees.  The crabs of the
trees perch from the branches and skuttle upon the floor, making your travel
through this grove hazardous, unless you enjoy being pinched.  The dark
wilderness is to the north and there seems to be some type of lake to the
south.

The Small Lake~
You have reached a small lake in the wilderness of the northern Xanth
forests.  The lake is full of cold clean water, and you feel that this is a
safe place to rest and regain your strength.  The wilderness crowds in again
to the west and the crabapple grove is to the north.

The Small Clearing~
You are in a small clearing inside northern Xanth.  This area is
relatively clear of any vegetation, as if something has STAMPED all life
from the forest here.  All sorts of vegetation here has been flattened, and
you can only wonder what could have caused this devastation.

The End of the Wilderness Near A Beach~
You are exploring the wilderness of northern Xanth.  This area
is pleasant by day, but full of danger by night as the shades,
wraiths, and ghoul come out, searching for victims to claim.  Natural
threats abound as well as the supernatural ones, tangle trees,
lion ants, basilisks, manticoras, dragons, and more roaming this
wild and magical land.  The wilderness comes to an end abruptly
here as a large sandy plain is seen to the west.  The thickening
of the trees blocks the southern path as it carries to the southeast.
A visible body of water suddenly shows to the west and stretches
to the northwest down to southwestern area.

The Shield~
You approach in a slight descent headed west where the wide waters
appear visible to the west.  The beauty of the water stretches
way beyond with a small structure seen from the southern distance.
A dirt trail heads to the east where the land ascends steadily
and greener plains lie.
