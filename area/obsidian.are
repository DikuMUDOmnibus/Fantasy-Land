Entrance to Obsidian Palace~
You are at the entrance of the Obsidian Palace.  Before you lies the
majestic spires and towers of the palace.  The ebon material it is
made of glows ominiously in the bright sunlight.  The whole of the palace
rises far above your head, impressing awe into your thoughts and very mind. 
The main gate is north, the path away is south.

palace gleam with an unearthly light as you approach.  Tall silver doors,

The gleaming ceiling, placed high above you, shines almost blindingly with
light, sending faceted rays of color streaming about you.  The silver doors
leading out of the palace are south, the way further inside the palace lies

You have managed to reach the Throne and gain an audience.  The two
thrones that face you are massive platinum and gold chairs, encrusted with
rare and valuable jewels.  A shining sceptre is placed inbetween the two
thrones, glittering with a cornucopia of light from the jewels set into the
pommel.  Heavy banners and tapestries line the translucent walls and
overhead a large stained glass skylight has been set into the obsidian ceiling,
depicting the Royal Crest of the Obsidian Palace Royalty.  Large gold braziers
filled with rare incense are burning in the corners of the room and a white
marble fountain is spouting water in the center.  A pair of black
leopards are chained and leashed to the fountains, snarling hungrily at you.

and glasses set upon the table is almost blinding in the already bright
glare of the room.  You hear the clattering of cooking utensils to the

You are in a corridor leading the the guest rooms.  Doors line the
hallway to the north and south, and various lanterns and braziers of flame
have been left here so the guests of the Royal Family may find their way in
safety.  A few elegant tapestries lines the walls inbetween the doors and a
current of cool air blows slowly by you, indication of a ventilation conduit
of some sort.

This is where the kings guests stay when visiting.  There is a large feather
bed here, with a small desk, a closet, and a few shelves.  The bed is 
covered in silken sheets and down pillows, and seems to take up most 
of this large room.  You notice a few sparse belongings here, but nothing

The Servants' Dining Hall~
You are in what appears to be the dining hall of the servants.  Nowhere
as stunning as the feasting hall, this room is not exactly shabby.  The
decor here is plain and simple, everything seeming to have a purpose of
usefullness rather than that of ornamentation.  The large wooden table seats
about forty people, but is made of a sturdy unfinished wood.  The lighting
of the room comes from a few open windows and a singe large copper brazier
in the middle of the table.  Simple stone plates and wooden mugs are set up
on the table, a bucket of water and some rags in the corner, ready to clean
up any messes made.

Entrance to the Dungeons~

generally abject and dismal mood fills this chamber, matching the grayish
lightning perfectly.  A few squeaks of vermin remind you that you are not
alone here.  The cells are to the south, the way back up is right above you.

The Secret Passageway~
You are in a secret passageway high in Obsidian Palace.  It is very dark 
here, and you are not sure quite where you are.  A few flickering torches 
give out just enough light so that you may barely keep from falling upon 
you own feet.  You stumble along the corridor, hoping nobody sees you here.

The Obsidian Hallway~
The blackness of the hallway seems to enshroud everything in it's 
ebon darkness.  Black sconces emit a black light which oddly enough
lights the room in an eerie glow.  Light and shadows play upon the 
recesses in the wall creating dark images in the imaginations of 
passersby.

You are in a royal chamber.  This spacious room is complete with large

porcelain figurines are placed about the room.  A gilt framed full body
mirror hangs upon the south wall and a dresser fully stocked with
embroidered clothes stands next to it.  A large platinum brazier burns
incense both for a fragrant aroma as well as for light.  You wonder who
could be important enough to book a room in the Royal Chambers, so secret
and well protected that the person must be a high official.

The Magician's Chambers~
You have discovered the chambers of the court's magician.  This chamber
is a total and utter mess.  Various beakers and vials lay strewn about the
floor and tables, spilling multi-colored fluids everywhere.  Star charts and
land mass maps are pinned to the walls, and pentagrams of every sort are
scrawled about.  Piles upon piles of books and large tomes are heaped
against the shelves, which look as if they are about to break under the
weight.  Jars of strange objects and dried animals are placed in the
northwest corner, and bags of herbs are heaped in the northeast corner.  It
is obvious that the palace maids never come up here.

outside to his main chamber.  It is at least neater outside.  The large bed
is completely covered with strange object that you can not even begin to
fathom the uses for.  Scrolls and parchments litter the floor so thoroughly
that you cannot take a single step without crushing something.  Dusty
amulets and talismans are hanging from hooks set into the walls everywhere. 
A strange bluish flame burns in the middle of the room, coming from no
apparant source.

very air is filled with herbal and sweet scents.  Strange yet colorful
bushes sprout from every corner, and odd trees grow about you.  Ferns and
vines mix together, and strange water lilies grow in the small lake that
sits serenely in the middle of the gardens.  The frogs croak loudly, adding
their voices to that of the birds and the dragonflies buzz incessantly here.
The whole garden maintains an aura of peaceful harmony and you feel at ease
here.

You have entered the war room of Obsidian Palace.  This is where the King
and his military advisors come and plan out their strategies if they are at
war.  There is a long glass table here and maps of every country and area in
the world are tacked up against the walls.  Books of strategy are shelved
neatly against the wall to the north, and a set of red marking pencils are
in a jar atop the books.  A large slate board is against the south wall, a
container of colored chalks next to it.  It seems the King takes warring
very seriously.

the chambers themselves are two totally different tasks.  The corridors are
filled with darkness and you have no idea what traps or guards may lay in
wait for you.  Perhaps you should leave now.

The Obsidian Hallway~
The blackness of the hallway seems to enshroud everything in it's 
ebon darkness.  Black sconces emit a black light which oddly enough
lights the room in an eerie glow.  Light and shadows play upon the 
recesses in the wall creating dark images in the imaginations of 
passersby.

few odds and ends lying about.  A pile of small torches lie against the
southeast corner, and a small rat runs over your foot as you explore about.

The Trap Room~
You have fallen into one of the many trap rooms deep within Obsidian Palace.
The Royal Family, having anticipated robbers, assassins, and other
troublemakers, has installed these trap rooms as a mean to deal with scum
like you.  As you stand there, the room tilts, sending you sliding down a
strange chute.  You are dumped into a strange courtyard.
