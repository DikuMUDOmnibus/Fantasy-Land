oldstyle marshall diana~
Marshall Diana~
Diana, the Marshall of Ofcol, stands here proudly.
~
Diana is a beautiful, powerfully built woman.  She wears platinum armor for
three reasons.  The first is to show she is strong enough to withstand the
weight.  The second is to show her rank of office.  The third is that platinum
is the hardest metal she can find.  She is willing to defend Ofcol to her 
death.

Captain Derrick~
Derrick, Captain of the Guard, is here disciplining his guards.
~
Derrick is a very big man.  He has acquired this station, not by brains or
charm, but by brute strength.  He had fought in three orc wars and is a
descendent of a surviving cityguard of old Thalos.  He believes that everything
has to be hard won to be kept, and that laxity is for the weak.

Captain Jacklyn~
Jacklyn, Captain of the Citadel Guard, is here raising morale.
~
Jacklyn is pale and wiry, but then, so are most other witches.  The fact that
Jacklyn is a mage and a warrior makes her the perfect captain of the citadel
guards.  Jacklyn is very beautiful, but whether it is due to her pale softness
or her magic, no one has ever found out.  She isn't very strong physically, but
she need not be.
