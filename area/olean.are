A {MCrossroad {yin {rthe {gTrail{x~
Your on a trail through Olean forest.  The trail is a muddy mess,
footprints of past travelers and rain have combined to destroy any chance of
walking at a fast pace.  The trees rise into the sky at an un believeable
height, and branch out, forming a canopy that does not allow alot of light
through, making it hard to see, even during light hours.  Underbrush and
large vines cover both sides of the trail, preventing anything larger than a
mouse from leaving the path.  The path T's off, leading North, East, and
South.

A {Bbend {yin {rthe {gTrail{x~
Your on a trail through Olean forest.  The sounds of birds and other
forest creatures are drowned out by a horrid screeching made by an animal,
or possibly a person, off in the distance.  The trees rise into the sky at
an un believeable height, and branch out, forming a canopy that does not
allow alot of light through, making it hard to see, even during light hours.
The path leads East and South.

A {Bbend {yin {rthe {gTrail{x~
Your on a trail through Olean forest.  Huge spiderwebs fill the backdrop
of the forest.  Cocoons, some reaching twelve feet in length hang from the
webs, the occasional twitch from inside the cocoon shows the recent
additions to the collection.  The sounds of birds and other forest creatures
are drowned out by a horrid screeching made by an animal, or possibly a
person, off in the distance.  The path leads North and West.

A {gTrail{x {rthrough {cOlean {GForest{x~
Your on a trail through Olean forest.  Large Vultures fly high above,
just below the canopy of trees, soaring, just waiting for the opportunity to
dive down and grab up a meal.  Leaves of all colors slowly descend from the
trees, almost like a golden rain.  The path leads North and South.

A {DDark Room{x~
This is a dark room, even with a light source, it is still almost
impossible to see anything.  The sounds of dripping water echos throughout
the room.  South seems to be the only exit from here.
