{$Chieftan's audience chamber{x~
The festivities are in full swing.  The guards seem to be protecting
someone or something to the north of here.  A large {1red{x and black banner
stretches across this hall from the eastern wall to the western.  An
unidentifable instrument is playing a fast tempo as some female orcs dance
around.  The music would amost send you into another world with the
exception that the surrounding are dirty and unkept.

The part of the hall, is quiet.  The is trash littered on the ground,
even a few bones are scattered about.  A few insects have chosen to join in
the join and are enjoying themselves to the refuse littered around the hall
as well.  Royalty themselves would shudder at the thought of stepping into
this place, but orcs appear to have lower standards.

In this corner of the hall, the orcs have placed their happy juices.  A
couple of tankards of some form of alcohol sit along the wall.  Of all the
places, this would probably be the least safe due to everyone in the hall
keep eyeing these tankards.  Loud shouts come from across that hall, a
kobold comes close to one of the tankards.  Many faces glare in this
direction.

{$Chieftan's audience chamber{x~
This is where some of the orc wenches have have gathered.  A loud voice
utters a word, and one of the wenchs goes north.  There is too much reveling
of these wenches, so you look to the wall, which is plain and decide this is
much more less stomach turning.  A few small spiders quickly walk across
your feet heading north.  One of the wenches picks up a spider and eats it. 
Soon, the rest who are waiting got on their knees looking for insects to
eat.

This is where most of the action is taking palce in the hall.  There is a
female orc dancing around in uncoordinated and clumsy ways.  An orc
imitating a human, walks around the hall, acting very polite to the guards
and wenches.  Laughter fills the hall, as many orcs point and even hit the
psuedo-jester on the head with the back of their hands.

{$The Chieftain's High Chair{x~
A mighty throne has been craved out of the side of the tree.  It is crude,
yet awe-inspiring in the same way.  It raises to 10 feet in height and is 5
feet wide.  There are many notches proving to show it has lasted many
battles, and there are many blood stains proving that move than one person
has died while on this throne.  A small set of steps lead up to the actual
seat.  One would almost consider stepping up but the large amount of
gaurds, and the occupant would never allow it.
