He represents the highest standard of Paladins in the whole today.  His

This is a stone path leading north and east.  On either side of the path,
the grass has been carefully manicured, giving it a neat appearance.  The
path itself is well-constructed, and appears to be maintained.  To the
northeast, you see a large stone walls which surround what must be the famed
Keep of Paladins.

Paladins.  The path under your feet is made from stones, fitting together
with remarkable precision and worn smooth from the multitudes of feet that
have walked upon them.  To the east and west, stairs allow access to the
upper walls of the parapets.  South leaves the Keep, and north appears to
head into a small courtyard.

The walls here show the same remarkable quality of workmanship, and would no

A large guard tower prevents further access to the parapets to the east,
save for members of the Keep.  The guards here appear relaxed, but they
could no doubt spring to action in the space of a few seconds.  Looking to
the north, you see a few buildings.  On the east and west sides of the Keep,
smaller facilities sit.  Numerous people appear to be gathered around the
eastern building, fighting mock battles and training for combat.  The
western building shows far less activity.  On the north side of the keep, a
large stone building sits.  The only exit from here is back to the west.

in-between training regiments.  Others are sitting on the stone benches that
have been placed around a lovely marble fountain that sits squarely in the
middle of the courtyard.  A number of people, in various states of
combat-readiness, walk around here.  Exits can be seen in all four cardinal
directions.

of having been tred by many people.  Off the edges of the path is a
beautiful grassy lawn.  A couple of signs placed on the edge of the path
instruct people not to tred upon the grass, unless they want to be the next
person to volunteer to mow the lawn.  A few people pass you by, absorbed in
thought.

they couldn't care less who enters the building.  East heads back towards
the courtyard, while west enters the barracks.

beds and footlockers.  Partitions seperate the mens side and the womens
side, otherwise there is nothing to distinguish any portion of the building
from another.  The beds stretch off to the north and the south.

Southern Barracks~
This is the southern side of the barracks used to house
paladins-in-training.  Neatly spaced beds line the walls, and footlockers
sit at the front of each bed.  Recruits are here in various states of
readiness.  Some are trying to catch a quick nap, while others are polishing
armor and sharpening weapons.  The only exit from here is to the north.

grass has been replaced by hard-packed dirt, and a number of trainees are
sparring or practicing their spells there.  Exits are east and west.

Before the Training Facility~
The path comes to an end here, and is replaced instead by a large dirt
circle where recruits drill and train daily, hoping to become full paladins
someday.  A number of instructors can be seen, teaching anything from the
basics of swordmanship to advanced horsemanship.  The large wooden door into
the building to the east is usually propped open, and a sign over the door
announces that this is the facility used for training.  East enters the
building, and west leads back towards the courtyard.

The Training Facility~
This is the entrance of a rather large facility.  A number of mats have
been placed on the floor, and students are being trained in the art of
unarmed combat.  Frequently, the hard sounds of someone hitting the mat can
be heard, along with the occasional grunt or exclamation.  Exits are
available in all four cardinal directions, though the only way to leave the
facility is to go west.

horsemanship training.  A sturdy wooden fence partitions this part away from
the rest of the building, though gates allow easy access in and out.  A
large stable juts off of the south part of the building, though it does
appear you won't be allowed access.  Several instructors are teaching
students the basics of riding and mounted combat, though a couple of scared
students are clinging to their horses as though their life depended on it.

Passage Behind the Bricks~
As soon as you enter the room, you are hit by the feeling of powerful
magic wards.  Multiple spells seem to be in place, apparently to keep
something or someone from entering the room.  A large notice has been pinned
to the wall.  Exits are east and west.

Demon Den~
The walls of this room exude pure waves of magic.  Obviously they have
been enchanted with powerful wards to prevent any sort of magical escape
from this room.  The room itself is in terrible shape.  The walls have deep
claws marks, and whatever furniture once inhabited the room has been smashed
to splinters and scattered all over.  The only exit from this room is west.

Hall Under the Keep~
The hallway under the keep here is lined with brick, which glows with a
magical light of its own.  A stairway sits at the north end of the hallway,
leading further downward.  Footsteps can be heard down there.  The only
other exit is south.

Bottom of the Stairs~
You are standing at the bottom of some stone stairs deep under the Keep. 
The light here is dimmer than it was above you, though it is still possible
to see.  The walls have been carved out of the natural stone under the
ground, and have been smoothed down over time.  Exits are north and up.

Hall Under the Keep~
Oddly, the walls here are lined with brick again.  In addition, the
ceiling has been bricked up and the stone floor has been covered by polished
floorboards which creak under your feet.  The boards show much wear from
many years of feet walking across them.  A stairway at the north end of the
hall leads downward.  The only other exit is to the south.

A Secret Passage~
This appears to be a passage hidden behind the bricks.  The walls are
bare, and the passage leading east is little more than a tube carved from
the rock.  The light here is dim, though it appears brighter to the east.

A Hidden Study~
This appears to be a small study hidden deep under the Keep.  The room is
somewhat spacious, and appears to have been made from the rock.  A few
pieces of old furniture have been placed in the room, including a rather
large bed.  The room is brightly lit by magical means, allowing for a clear
view of everything.  The only exit is west.

Bottom of the Stairway~
You are standing at the bottom of a set of stairs.  The area here is
brightly lit through the liberal use of magic, allowing for clear vision up
and down the hall.  The walls here appear to have been hewn out of the rock,
and smoothed to incredible perfection.  Off to the west you think you see a
door.  The only other exit is up the staircase.

Bright Hallway~
You are standing in the middle of a corridor leading west and east.  The
area is very well lit, allowing you to see the decorations that line the
hallway.  Various statuettes and figurines have been set on shelves along
the hall.  The majority appear to have been carved from jade or other
precious stones.  A magical ward prevents their unauthorized taking.

End of the Hall~
The hall ends here with a large wooden door.  Numerous large statues line
the hall, standing virtually shoulder to shoulder with each other.  A simple
note has been affixed to the wooden door on the western end of the hall. 
The only other exit to the east.

Eastern End of the Library~
You are standing in a huge library.  Countless numbers of bookshelves are
set up all over the room, which is rather cavernous in its own right.  Books
of all shapes and sizes line the bookshelves.  Others have been stacked on
tables scattered throughout the room.  Many of the texts are in languages
unfamiliar to you.  A few have been propped open to a certain page, perhaps
for later study.  The room itself is very brightly lit through a large
number of continual light spells.  No doubt the owner of this fabulous
library does not trust the open flame of a torch near their books.  East
leaves the library, and west appears to delve deeper into the room.

Western End of the Library~
This appears to be the far west end of the cavern that makes up the
library.  Shelves upon shelves of rare and ancient texts are here for the
reading.  A huge table has been set in the middle of the room, with ornate
chairs placed around it for researchers to use.  A small sign on the table
reminds scholars to replace their books once they are finished with them. 
The only exit from this place is to the east.

Entrance to the Paladin's Keep~
You stand on a well-made stone path leading north towards the Keep of
Paladins.  Directly ahead of you stands an archway, the entrance to this
famed keep.  To the east and south the patch is blocked by a combination of
high stone walls and thick bushes.  Stern-looking guards line the walls,
watching for suspicious individuals.  Further to the north you spy a large
building, though you can't make out much more than its general shape and
appearance.
