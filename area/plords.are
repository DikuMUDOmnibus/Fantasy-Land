nudged him and he broke out of his block. With Rainman
doing the main debugging and alot of dark beer, this
area was created for your amusement. The secret to sailing
is that all simple seas never border on grounding reefs.
If you are in shallows type exit after each move to look 
for shoals ( they wont show in the night ). There is a main
clockwise current running in the high seas, so don't sleep
on the high seas, or you will drift.. There are alot of 
clues throughout isles so don't just powermud and miss all.
Lok charmed me so you wouldn't just mindlessly butcher me.'

In the Shadow of the Flying Mountain~
Incredibly, above you, suspended in mid-air, is a huge mountain. You
bob in the shallow waters shaded by the flying mountain. You crane your
neck upward and see high above you massive chains and winches which
support many pirate ships beneath the flying mountain. Also, high above
you, you can make out a rope ladder. Sadly the ladder, too, has been 
wound most of the way up, and is far out of your reach. Your boat bumps
a buoy.

   It's amazing, but the water here seems to look shallower, although
you know that cannot be true at this distance from the shores. It
almost looks like magic could be at play at this particular spot --
which causes you to remember back to an old tale of an underwater city
somewhere in these waters....

atoll~
You shimmy up your mast and look at the atoll. The atoll is a circular
island with a quiet lagoon in the middle. The only way into the central
lagoon appears to be via the north end of the atoll. In the lagoon, you
can easily recognize the masts of several docked ships, and you see
houses on stilts.

inscription strange rock~
Carved into the rock in wizard runes is the following:
` BEWARE-Enchanted Lodestone: I was on holiday on this 
deserted island, practicing on my enchantment spells, 
when in the middle of casting, I was rudely interrupted by
a mystic summons. The interruption threw my spell off target
and onto the island itself. With a wrenching crunch the whole
island rose from the sea to the position you find it now. 
Intrigued by the phenomena I took a sample of the rock back
to my shack in the Forest Arden, where I determined by 
methods of alchemy that the island had rich deposits of
lodestone, which when subjected to enchantment magic, flies.
I have used this discovery to create several floating trinkets
which impart the ability of flying to the recipient. Beware
for I know not how long this enchantment will last. - MERLIN'

A Room in the Hold~
You are in a sparsely furnished room, obviously occupied by men at arms.
Low pallets are on the north and south walls. A small fire glows in
a pit in the room center, and the smoke winds its way upward and out
a high iron barred window. Near the window is a platform from which
an archer could stand and fire.

You feel warmth returning to your bones, and you welcome the quiet 
splendor of the ice interior. Next to you in the cave are several triremes
anchored at bay. You anchor and hop down onto the hard packed ice, 
following a trail of footprints to a dead end passage. Puzzled, you get on
your hands and knees, and feel the outline of an ice trap door beneath you.

At the Bonfire in the Great Ice Cavern~
You stand next to a roaring bonfire in the great ice cavern. Logs some ten 
feet in length are stacked crosswise to a height of 5'. The flames warm and 
light the cavern, and most importantly, your backside. Bedrolls are cast 
about the fire, and primitive shelving has been carved into the surrounding 
stalagmites. The heat from the fire is so great that it has melted the ice into
a pool of water.
