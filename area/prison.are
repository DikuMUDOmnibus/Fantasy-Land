pacing the floors trying to calm down.

Path to the Prison~
The prison looms ahead.  The grounds are massive, and there
are no trees and the shrubbery is kept low so that the 
guards can maintain a good view of the prisoners.  It is a
very bleak place, a place of punishment.

Prison Street~
The prison street is very sanitary.  The guards work the prisoners very
hard to keep the grounds spotless and clean.  There is no trash anywhere. 
Everything seems very orderly...  Almost too orderly.

A secret prison!~
You are in a secret prison cell, where the warden keeps his "play toys". 
Elinthia seems to be the flavor of the month.  When he tires of her, he'll
find another helpless prisoner to fulfill his sick desires.  The room reeks
of sex, which normally isn't a bad thing, but this is degrading sex.... 
What a shame they put people in power who take advantage of others.

crimes.  Not that repention will give them any respite from their
punishment, the guards just like to see how long a man can go before he is
broken.

The Recreation Yard~
The recreation yards loom on for miles.  Prisoners can get
all the exercise they need here.  A long track circles the 
yard.  It is so large, that many get confused as to where 
they are.

The Prison Gardens~
You are standing in the prison's gardens.  Neat rows of vegetables and
flowers surround you.  They must be pretty self efficient here, but the
better the food they make, the better the food they eat.

The Beggining of an escape tunnel~
Fresh dirt is everywhere...  It is evident that this is one of the newest
attempts at escape from this hell of a prison.  The escapees haven't gotten
very far in their attempt tho....  Perhaps they will manage to finish their
tunnel before the guards catch them, but most likely not.

A Dark Tunnel~
Can it be? YES! An escape route! From this tunnel emanates the sweet smell 
of green grass and fresh air. You can clamber through and escape, though
the tunnel is so narrow you doubt you'd be able to return through it.
