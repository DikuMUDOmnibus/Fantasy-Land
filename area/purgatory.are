The Haunted Glade~
A small stream runs through the center of the clearing, gurgling almost

creatures linger in this clearing.  The clouds clear quite suddenly from the
sky.  In the silver light of the moon you see what it is that lingers here. 
Exits lead west and down.

A Stall~
Straw covers the floor of the stall.  A wooden feed trough sits in one
corner.  This is where the goblins imprison the pixies until they are fat
enough to slaughter.  You shiver in revulsion as you realize what is being
