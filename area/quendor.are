algen~
Algen~
Algen is here, looking for an escape route.
~
He hides in the shadows and takes all he wants.  For many years he did
this until finally the law caught up with him.  The King decided to lock him
up and throw away the key, he has escaped many times, but everytime the King
has caught up with him and placed him back into his prison.  He yearns the
day he can go free to his destructive nature once again, and your death is
one of many steps he will take to gain it.

cyclops~
the Cyclops~
The undead remains of the Cyclops join together and attack.
~
Once the most feared creature in all of Quendor, his habit of devouring
the personal slaves of the King brought great dislike to him throughout the
realm.  So much so, that his main wizardess asked Marauder to deal with the
problem himself.  The King personally hunted the Cyclops to his home and
then slayed him in a great and long battle.  The Cyclops' punishment is to
walk the dungeon for eternity, a prisoner within his own body.

Trapped in the deep hole of Quendor!~
You have entered the dungeon of the all powerful, cruel and vicious King
Marauder of Quendor.  You wish you could turn back, but it is too late, for
the way you entered no longer exists.  The walls of this room are covered in
vines and moss, the floor is black with cracks running along it.  The room
is dimly lit, and an uncomfortable aura seems to emanate all around you, you
get the feeling that things aren't as they seem within this hostile realm.

Here you stand within a hallway of the dungeon.  If the entrance made you
feel unsafe, this room is only helping to enhance that feeling.  Along the
walls lies shackles, most likely used for torturing those stupid or
unfortunate enough to be captured, however judging from the dust that has
gathered, this particular room seems to have suffered from lack of use in
recent times.

You have entered one of the many hallways of this vast dungeon.  The
walls are lined with moss, and yet you can see some flowers growing on one
of the many vines.  The floor is made of a dark stone that seems to be of an
extraordinary age.  So much so that it seems it may even be older than the
dungeon itself, which strikes you as very odd.

remains of these slaves, it seems the only food they received in here were
the rats they caught.

You have entered a dark and damp hallway.  You try and look at your

Your light source is little if any use, however you do notice an inscription
on the wall.  You move over to it, but can only make it out by rubbing your
hand over it's surface.  Unfortunately you have never seen or heard of
anything quite like this, so it is meaningless to you at this very moment in
time.

Crypt Anteroom~
Here lies the Crypt room of Quendor's dead.  Many of those who were
tortured are left here to rot, with corpses lined up to your knees, you get
a very uncomfortable feeling about this place.  The smell of these rotten
corpses is awful, so much so that you have to block your nose.  There seems
to be some unusually large bugs making homes within the rotting corpses,
perhaps it is best to leave before they consider you for their next home.

Crypt~

the hands of her father.  In recognition of his mistake and in honor of his
lost daughter, he had a special crypt built especially.  The walls are made
of a dark rock, with thorny vines hanging down from the roof.  Unfortunately
another cruel twist of fate meant that the princess never made the crypt,
and hence can never rest in peace.

dealing with the only person with the funds to support such a business, the
King himself.  You notice that the teller's window where the transactions
are done is a little north of here.

You have entered the bank's offices.  The walls in this section are made
of a white rock, and has a portrait of the owner sitting on the east wall. 
Standing behind the teller's window is George, the bank clerk, who is ready
to accept your transaction.

Hallway~
You have entered a dark hallway, made of the darkest of rock, so dark
in fact that the stone seems to absorb any light that hits them.  As your
eyes try to get accustomed to the light around you, you can just make
out entrances lying to the north and south.

Hallway~
You have entered yet another of the dark hallways within this vast
dungeon.  This particular piece of hallway from what you can tell is
identical to the hallway to the north of here.  However you notice a small
gap to the west, but there seems to be an unpleasant odour, it also seems
that it was walled in at one stage, there was probably a reason.

Dragon Room~
OHHH NOOO!  You wish you could turn back, but alas you are trapped within
the dragon room of Quendor.  Only now do you understand why this area had
been walled off, for the smell coming from the north could only be that of
rotting corpses.  The walls of this room are red and from what you can see,
many travellers have died within this room, unable to bring themselves to
travel into the Dragon's Lair.

Dragon's Lair~
You have stepped foot into the Dragon's Lair, the home of the biggest
creature you have ever seen, the fierce and ruthless dragon named Shan.
This lair is huge, which is expected considering the size of the creature
that makes its home here, with red walls, lined with the cindered bodies of
others that have disturbed him within his lair.  There seems to be no way
out of your predicament, for Shan does not treat visitors with any mercy
whatsoever.

from the moisture and there is a small breeze passing by which is being
cooled as it moves by the puddles.

they swoop down towards you, you try to dodge them, but to no avail, for
they are too big to avoid.  These bats are really getting on your nerves,
but it seems the only way to stop them is to kill them.

Now you have gone and done it.  Before you stands the cruel master of all
the puppets of Quendor, the Magister.  His creations cruelty are in every
way an equal to their masters.  Within these dark walls are many puppets yet
to be put into service, as well as plans for more diabolical creations.  It
is said the Magister likes to dissect those who oppose his power, you should
turn back, if only you could.

reason for the massive amplification of sound within this room.  You are

these formations.  Unfortunately, not only do they look unique, but they
also look somewhat unstable, it is probably best to keep moving.

Oh gosh!!  You have entered the most repulsive room you've ever come
across in all your years.  There is nothing to explain it, nor do you have
any desire to investigate the reason, for the smell that is wafting back and
forth across the room is totally unbearable.  The strange thing is that you
can not see, nor think of any reason that could have caused such a revolting
stench, in fact, you are the only thing in this room.

room in all of Quendor, it has now become just another unused part of the
dungeon.  Along the walls are the small spouts that were used to fill the
room with gas when an execution took place, considering the nature of this
room, it seems surprising that someone such as the King would forsake it.

history.  At one stage in it's history, this mine would produce 10000 gold
per day for the King, but unfortunately due to lack of use in the last 20
years has caused it to become quite unstable.  From what you can deduce, it
seems that the whole area around this mine was deserted at the same time
that this mine ran dry.

unused for the past 20 years.  The rocks around you are crumbling and the
wires supporting the lift are starting to break.  Your sense of safety tells
you that if you are going anywhere, best to get there quickly before the
wires break.

carriageway system of the mine has been left intact.  There are 6
carriageways, and if the rumours of this place are correct, at it's peak,
they were all overused, such was the productivity of the mine below.  From
what you can tell, the stock was moved to destination somewhere to the
south.

have been something very important through the south exit, but it has been

housed south of here, will stay a mystery to those who he doesn't feel are
fit to grace such knowledge.

creating it.  The breeze seems to be moving from south to north, regardless
of whether it should or should not exist, it does, and it is getting
stronger, so much so that it's beginning to push you north!

fish within this aquarium, it isn't funny, but where would the beings who
dwell within a dungeon be able to get hold of such an assorted collection,

your own, and there doesn't seem to be anything between it and the wall, but
the point still remains, they are there, perhaps it be best to leave before
their actions become more than just gestures towards you.

explanation for how a shadow could be in control of their own actions,
within these walls they are.  The nature of this room gives you an extremely
uncomfortable feeling, so much that you feel it is best to turn around and
leave the way you entered before something unfortunate occurs.

within this room bar your own, nor is their any movement by anything that
could be causing these shadows.  Such is the comforting nature, that you get
the feeling you could stay for awhile, but considering the danger you have

juices.  Although the craw worm leaves his lair to hunt his prey, he always
brings it back, and leaves it to digest for up to a year.  The smell within
this room is horrible, the only reason the craw worm can live here is
because it has no sense of smell.

around this room, as if the toys themselves are moving by their own free
will.  After looking around you come to leave, but the door is now in a
different position, quite strange indeed, but from what you have already
seen within this dungeon, it is not a complete surprise.

King's slaves.  But unlike the Cyclops, the craw worm was and still is
required to help keep the rat population down.  For this reason, a special
room was built littered with rat bait so as too lure the rats to within his
grasp, for now the only people which become his food, are the unfortunate
who stumble unknowingly into his lair.

bodies.  Although unused since his death a few years ago, it is thought that

Treasure Room~
This room used to hold all the wealth of the Kingdom of Quendor, guarded
by the half man, half lizard, it was used by the last 20 generations of
rulers to store their wealth.  Unfortunately in recent times, many skilled
thieves had managed to steal large portions of the King's wealth.  A man
named George, then a slave who had visited the outside world conviced the
King that his wealth would be much safer if stored within the economical
community of the whole world.  The King agreed, and after a small trial was
most pleased with George, and so the King's slaves started removing all of
his wealth from this room and storing it within the new system.  Although
this room is now totally empty, the half man, half lizard still guards it
with his life, unaware and incapable of understanding what has happened.

would have King Marauder, a ruler that rules through fear allow such a room
to be constructed, not just maintained.  The room is lined with limestone
and there are extravagant engravings depicting great battles, and from what
you can tell these may be the victories of the King himself, which would
explain the answer to the problem you posed.

This was the private serving room for the Princess of Quendor.  Since she
spent much of her time within the dome room, dreaming of the outside world,
this room was built where the slaves would bring her what she required.  For
the King banned them from ever entering the dome room, punishable by death,
the slaves would come to this room and ring the bell in order to get the
Princess' attention.  This is but a simple room, with no furnishing
whatsoever, and the only item that still remains is the bell the slaves once
used.

ever be able to break through the glass barrier that makes up the ceiling of
this room.  Not only is it about 50 feet in the air, from a few rocks you
threw up there, it seems there is also an invisible magical barrier up
there, love his daughter he did, trust her, it seems not.

this one seems to have no substance about it.  It's as if the room itself
was one giant illusion.  The other noticeablt thing is the temperature, it
is almost as cold as the ice room in here, wonder what could possibly be
living here.

Ghoul Room~
This is a simple, basic room, used as a passageway for movement by the
living and for the passage of time for the unliving.  The living that travel
through here seem to move through rather quickly, as you see no signs of
anyone ever staying here.  You can feel the spirits urging you to sleep, but
you get this uncomfortable feeling about it, like the other living, it is
probably best to move on quickly.

Dead Room~
You have entered the realm of the dead.  After the slaves are killed,
their skeletons are places within the skeleton room, and their souls are
trapped within the room of the dead.  For the king believes those who are
his servants in life, shall belong to him for eternity, and so his wizards
created this room to trap the souls of the dead.  You just hope there are
none around at the moment.

Play Room~
Here before you is the famous playroom of the princess of Quendor.  Built
by her father when he was still the prince 25 years ago, this room was built
in honor of her birth.  Decorated lavishly, with all the things that anyone
could need in such a room, she used to spend great amounts of time here
playing with other people, including the children of the slaves, for she was
such a sweet and kind person.

Undead Cave~
Around you are the many screams of the undead, their souls tortured and
forced to walk these halls.  It is said that noone who enters ever leaves
these walls, not even in death, as all who die spend eternity trapped.  You
can almost feel the pain they must be going through, banished to an
existence of eternal torment.  This room is totally empty, for none who live
within the dungeon will ever enter such a damned place.

Rat Room~
You have entered a room infested with rats.  Everywhere you look there
are rats scurrying around, they are even starting to climb all over you. 
You can not even see the ground, for if there is not a rat, there is some
piece of rotting corpse on the ground, and this is not a small room at all. 
All of a sudden, the rats start scurrying into a small exit to the north,
ravaged with fear, and as you turn around to see what it was, you notice the
biggest rat you've ever seen in your life, this thing has to be at least 5
foot high, and it is looking at you in a very strange way.

Snake Room~
You have entered the realm of the snakes.  Within these walls many were
sacrificed to a being they believed to be mystical, for only a few know of
it's true existence.  The room is dull grey colour, with a cool damp soft
dirt floor, perfect for the dwelling of the Derelor.  The rest of the room
holds nothing, for the snake swallows his prey whole.

Eclipse Room~
You see before you a most beautiful room.  Used by the personal mages of
the king, their job is to predict the future for him.  This room is full of
all the magical equipment any mage would or could need.  The floors and wall
are made of a dark black rock, but it's texture is like nothing you have
ever seen.  It is said the mages have never been wrong, they even predicted
the death of the king's daughter at his own hand, this prediction caused him
to doubt his wizards, but since it came true, he has never doubted them
since, plus they have always been given whatever they require in honor of
the service they provide.

Black Cave~
You have entered a crumbling cave.  All around you, parts of the cave are
falling apart, this is not very safe at all.  You think that very soon the
cave entrance could crumble, and leaved you trapped, buried alive beneath
tons of rock.

Red Room~
You have entered a room commonly called the red room, simply because of
the bright red walls.  This room is used by the mages who fortell the King's
future as a storage room for all their magical equipment.  Due to the
importance of their work, the King assigned a group of a dozen slaves whose
jobs are to make sure that all the equipment that is stored here is kept in
prime condition.

outstanding about this room, it is simply a grey cave, used as a passageway
through the dungeon.  There are no signs of life, nor are there any signs of
danger.

king himself is known to come here to hone his skills.  By the look of all
the blood splattered around the place, you think that some that have come
here have been involved in a little more than friendly sparring.

You have entered another bone room of the dungeon, but this is one is far
different to the others you have come across.  Many of these bones seem to
have been cleanly sliced through, as if a blade of remarkable sharpness had
caused it.  Could these bones be the remains of what is left of those the
King has slain himself ?

extravagant chandalier, and the bed you see before you is so large you can
hardly believe your eyes.  From the stories you have heard with the Queen,
you wonder how happy she would be with your unwelcome intrusion.

room is huge, you see a bath that is so big that 4 people could probably fit
in with ease.  Another interesting facet that catches your eyes are that all
the taps are shaped in the form of fish, makes you wonder why anyone would
need something like this.

King.  If torture devices are what the king plays with, he's probably
someone you wouldn't want to meet.  You can't help but notice a smell coming
from underneath this room, it seems so vile, even your curiosity has taken a
backwards step, for you feel more alone now than you have ever before in
your life.

there are bustling around you .  Most of them appear not to be here by
their own free will, but they try their best to put on a happy face so as
to not attract the displeasure of the King.

Of all the things you have seen here in Quendor, this is the most
surprising.  This room is decorated in lavish decor, with a huge bed at the
end of the room.  It seems the friends of the King are treated with great
respect, maybe he isn't as evil as you have been led to believe ?

must have earned throughout his life.  You also notice grand portraits, the
titles below them seem to be those of the previous leaders of Quendor, they
all seem grand, but even their portraits give away their evil intent.

missing.

it.  It begins closing in, and unfortunately there is nowhere you can escape
to from your ledge, the vortex soon engulfs you, and bang, you are gone.

Dragon's Recluse Room~
Although so feared that virtually noone would dare enter his lair, a
select few such as the King will visit to seek his vast wisdom anyhow.  This
room hiddem behind his lair is blocked by a 50 foot door, of which only Shan
himself has the key.  Shan will come to this room to gather rest, for he
needs sleep approximately once every 40 days, and within these walls, he can
get it without the threat of unwelcome company.

direction.  Bloated and rotting corpses float in the water as large evil
looking birds feast on their flesh.  The river continues to the north and

waterfall.

before you stands a large cavernous entrance.  There is a small sign here
attached to the glistening rock wall, and several mean-looking guards eye
you suspiciously.
