Mountain top~
The view from this small mountaintop is very special.  You are
closer to the heavens than you'll ever get.  The view from here
reveals much about the valley far below.  Below you a river can
be seen bisecting the valley floor.  A small valley and garden
as well as the bridge crossing the river are completely surrounded
by a ten or twelve foot high wall.  Two towers protect the valley
entrance to the enclosure.

Made from natural stone, the one story buildings are simple yet

the river appear to be guarding a gate leading to the valley.

doors, low to the ground, provide entrance to the towers.  The

Base of Boulders~
The boulders have been stacked to block travel on the ancient
road.  Large stakes, sharpened and pointed toward the wall,
keep travellers on the road.

Path along boulders~
A small path travels along the roadblock to the west.  Skirting
along sharpened stakes the path meanders amoungst and besides
the huge boulders stacked precariously across the ancient road.

A path~
The path comes to an abrupt halt.  The boulders curve inward,
towards the city, and with the aid of the sharpened stakes all
about you travel in this direction has been effectively cut off.

You are approaching the end of the palm path.  Several buildings
to the north of you appear to be both warehouses and living
quarters.  The smell of drying fish is evident and a small fishing
boat has been drydocked for repair.

Land's End Road~
This is the only "road" in Land's End.  The most accurate
description would be a path.  On both sides of you stand large
warehouses where tradegoods are stored.  A few fishing nets
hang from nearby trees and a drying rack produces that strong
fish smell which spreads through the air.

Two homes stand nearby as well as a rowboat and three fishing
vessels drydocked for the season.  Perhaps the fishing is bad.

Garden along the river~
The garden continues to parallel the mountain river.  While walking
through the carrots you glance south into the river and see the
remains of a wooden bridge washed ashore.  The bridge is flimsy
and ill made and obviously was not meant to be permanent.

From this part of the garden you have an excellent view of the
river as it passes through the fence.  A huge section of the
12 foot high fence is missing above the river.  Perhaps a massive
rain washed that section of the fence away?

The tracks you see are well defined and
were obviously made by an unshod foot.
The toes are extremely long and end with
curved talons.~

Outside the West Tower~
The soft ground here shows evidence of recent travel.  Some of
the many marks in the ground were obviously made by booted
soldiers while the unshod footprints appear to have been made
by nonhuman feet.  The prints are elongated and end in talons.

and the yellowing bones of two or three skeletons are scattered

The closer you get to the river the bushier it becomes.  Squeezing

This small path has seen little traffic in recent times.  There

however, no man sized creatures have passed this way for years.
The river is rushing past you and flows through the large hole in
the fence to your right.  Perhaps a large rain washed it away?

surrounds the village.  To the east is a large hole in the fence.
The river runs through that hole.

Dariuas's Royal Chambers.~
Upon the floor lies a long red carpet leading to a table which is
surrounded by seven chairs.  On the other side of the table, a large blue
colored throne resides.  The walls are made from a black marble, nine
pillars line the room, made from a white marble.  Here is the room where
Dariuas makes chivalrous deeds, with his band of nobles.  Behind the large
throne is a picture in a wooden frame.  The picture contains an event in the
time of Dariuass life when he rose to the havens to lead the world in peace
and honor.  A strange marble door lies to the east of the room.  Seemingly
the only way out.
