elven girl elf~
a little elven girl~
A little naked elven girl runs past you in the sand giggling to herself.
~
Her hair is long and hangs down to the middle of her back.  She giggles
and runs past you, as if she is chasing after something.  She wears no
clothes about her little body and seems very carefree, as if she has never
seen nor done violence in her life.  You cannot guess her age as she is an
elf, but you would think her very small.  She looks at you quickly as she
runs by, blinking innocently with sparkling eyes but showing no signs of
slowing down.  You wonder what it is she could be after.

The legendary unicorn grazes here peacefully.

Before you stand the legendary unicorn.  Her white coat is clean and
glistens in the light.  The horn atop her head looks as if it could be made
from gold.  Her mane is long as is her tail, both shining as if streaked
with strands of silver, as well as the tufts of hair around her hooves.  She
grazes amongst the grass peacefully, as if nothing has ever threatened her.

but you see in his body a wirey strength.  His hair is black and tied back
from his face as he works over the hot forges.  He has been the maker of
weapons and other steel objects for many years, even making the weapons for
the wars long ago.  He does not look up as you enter his shop but keeps
about his work.  It is obvious he does not have time to sit and chat.  In
his hand he holds a large hammer that seems to glow with magic, sparking as
it hits the steel.

Throne Room of the Riathan Palace~
As you step into the throne room your footsteps echo through the vast
chamber.  The floor beneath your feet and the pillars that support the
vaulted ceiling are of white marble, streaked with veins of black and gold. 
Flames flicker from polished silver lanterns trimmed with gold and set into
the walls.  Leading from the doorway to the back of the chamber where two
thrones sit is a carpet of the deepest crimson edged with gold brocade.  In
the corners of the room are four statues of young elven children.  The
detail is so great they almost seem frozen in time, their innocent young
faces unaware of your eyes upon them.  On the east wall you notice a large
arched doorway.

gold.  The beautiful stone looks very ancient and of an unequaled quality. 
Large pillars sit along the walls and in the center of the room you see a
large table.  It is of the blackest marble and contrasts greatly to the rest
of the room.  It looks large enough to seat twenty people and is wide enough
to fit two across at one end.  At what would be the head of the table you
see two large chairs of gold, side by side.  The backs of each chair are
raised and at the top sits the symbol and jewel of Riathan.  Other smaller
golden chairs have been places around the table and on the wall opposite the
tables head you see a large painting.

Before Two Large Double Doors~
You stand in a marble hall before two large wooden double doors.  On each
is the symbol of Riathan inlaid in gold on the polished wood.  A crimson
carpet lined with gold leads down the hall to the south and to the north
into the Throne Room.  On each side of the doors stands a guard.  They watch
you closely while appearing to also stare straight ahead.  To the west you
can also see another large wooden door.

The Sleeping Chambers of the Prince and Princess~
This large room is covered with a thick carpet of the deepest blue.  In
it you see tiny streaks of white and light blue, forming designs that you
must peer at to see.  Coming forth from the northern wall is a huge bed like
none you have seen.  The bedposts rise up to a canopy that covers the bed
and from it hang drapes of sheer lace and silk.  The bed itself is covered
in silken sheets and large stuffed blankets.  Pillows of all sizes and
shapes cover the bed making it look like one of the most comfortable places
in existance.  On the eastern wall sits a small chair and table, on top of
which a large mirror has been placed.

You stand on the pure white sand of a large island with the waves of the
ocean to the south.  The sand is soft and amazingly clean and white.  You
gaze up at the sky and see that somehow it has changed from it's normal look
over the water to colors of purple and blue.  It appears very enchanting and
the swirling colors seem to change randomly.

against the beach making a soft rustling sound.  A small breeze blows
through your hair and it feels warm and inviting.  You wonder what kind of
place this could be that is so different and beautiful compared to other
lands.  As you stand in wonder you hear a small giggle close by.

it hard to see very far out.  To the west the white sand gives way to
naturaly smooth rocks that rise up and lead to the north, almost like a wall
of sorts.  You think this place could be one of surprise and wonder like you

The Top of a Large Hill~
You are at the top of a steep hill and as you look down you wonder how
you made it this far.  The sky above you looks the same but you feel somehow
closer to it.  The top of the hill is large and flat and like all things
here it seems odd, but yet so natural.

The Top of a Large Hill~
You walk on the top of the large hill and look down to where it's edge
falls to the groud below.  You do not think you could climb down this side
as it is even more steep than the way you came up.  Above you the white
misty clouds swirl in delicate patterns through the colored sky.

bit closer to the magical sky above, with it's changing colors and soft
white clouds.  You peer over the edge to the ground below and know that it

down below you see that the slope is not as steep as the others.  Also to
the east you see a large sparkling lake.

A Secluded Grassy Alcove~
You stand on thick grass that seems softer than the grass before, if that
is possible.  To the west a hill rises up above you and beyond that sits the
magical sky of changing colors.  To the west you see a large lake that
sparkles in the light, as if it to was as magical as he sky.

without even touching it.  You notice the prints of an animal here as well
and recognize them as those of a horse, or so it seems.  You wonder how a
horse could get here glancing to the huge hill a ways to the west.  The
grass here is soft and green, like all the grass you have seen on this
island.

grass at your feet and a tall red mountain that rises up out of the fog to
meet the mass of blues and purples in the sky.

Within the Grassland~
All around you the grasslands exend in all directions.  A rolling fog
dims the sound and through the haze you can make out a mountain to the
north, like a red stain against the sky.

In the Grassland~
Beneath your feet is a carpet of rich soft green grass that extends all
around you.  Hanging in the air is a rolling fog, that blankets you and all
around you.  To the north you can make out a tall mountain rising up out of
the fog.

Walking in the Grassland~
As you walk along the soft grassland a small mist rises up from your
footsteps.  It rolls over your feet as if it is being pushed by your
movements.  Far to the south you can see a tree line of tall evergreens and
a ways to the north a large mountain rises into the sky.

In the Soft Grassland~
The grass is soft under your feet so that is feels somewhat unnatural
compared to other grass you have seen and felt.  Yet, in a way, it seems
completely natural like it was the way things were meant to be.  As natural
as the colored sky above, in all it's red's, blue's and violet's.

grasslands seem to end.  Far to the south you can see a line of trees.

The Grasslands~
Walking here on the soft green grass a feeling of calmness comes over
you.  Above the sky slowly changes it's hue from violet to deep blue and
through it runs streaks of white cloud.  The grass under your feet is bright
and you wonder how it came to be this way.

sand, it's peak cannot be seen as it lies beyond the clouds and into the
colored sky.

Just before you lies a huge mountain, rising into the sky so that you
cannot see it's peak.  You can see the mountain holds many ledges that do
not look to have been travelled in quite some time.  The stone of the
mountain is dust brown and contrasts against the bright green landscape that
lies all around you.

ground and into the clouds.  Very far to the south you can barely make out a
tree line.

seems to hold you just fine but for some reason you are a little uneasy.

high above the ground.

grass.  It looks large enough to hold a small man.  You wonder what kind of
animal would build a nest this high up, or be that big to have one.  You

color as all the walls of the Palace.  In it's center is the symbol of
Riathan inlaid in solid gold.  It looks as if it would be enough gold to
make serveral solid gold statues.  The ceiling is high and from it hangs a
crystal chandelier that reflects the flickering light of the golden lanterns
that hang alone the walls.  A long marble table sits along the eastern wall
and looks as if it could fit the royal family and more.
