Millie the Ghost~
Millie is here, combing her hair.
~
Millie the Ghost is a beautiful and sexy woman that is no longer a ghost.
Restored to life by Bink, she became Dor's nanny.  She is a VERY attraction
lady, with long straight hair and a ravishing body.  It is no wonder she is
able to turn heads wherever she is, since her talent is sex appeal.  She has
married Jonathan, the Zombie Master, falling in love with him once Dor,
travelling to the past and inhabiting a muscular warrior's body, jilted her
on his quest to restore Jonathan to life in the present.

Jonathan the Zombie Master~
The Zombie Master is here, helping Millie.
~
Jonathan is a gaunt older man, used to solitude and loneliness.  A full
magician, his powers of reanimated the dead into zombies caused most people
to dislike him.  After Millie disappeared eons ago, he hung himself and
turned into a zombie.  Dor's quest to find an elixir to restore Jonathan to
life resulted in the Zombie Master meeting Dor in the past.  He was restored
to life in the present, and owes Dor BIG TIME.
