A Courtyard~
The stone ground is covered with dried blood and gashes of the battles
long past. There is a sturdy 10 foot wrought iron fence running north and
south with no gate to the east. The doorway to the east is dimly lit and
a rather cool breeze flows through into the Courtyard.

A Side Hallway~
The room is completely clear of any tools and scrap metal. It's as if it
was cleaned completely. The only thing in the room is the light, which
displays nothing out of the ordinary.

The hallway reeks of death and rotted flesh. The slime covered walls
apparently haven't detered past adventurers from advancing. A low
menacing growl echos through the hallway.

Human skeletons and dried blood are abundant in this room. In the

A Courtyard~
The fence come to a doorway an instantly angles up and is about 15 
feet high and looks very deadly. The ground has a bit more dried blood
then the other parts and it seems to start at the doorway thus stating the
awful true intended purpose for it is. The fortress ramparts loom just a
stones throw north.

Approaching the Fortress~
Approching the massive fortress the cannons on the ramparts sit unused
since the last battle. The ramparts are covered with vines and moss, as
are the cannonballs. There is noone watching over the lands, nor the bridge
providing entry unnoticed.
