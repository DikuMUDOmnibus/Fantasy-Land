Temple of Creation~
You stand inside the hallowed interior of the Temple of Creation.  This 
is one of the few stable areas where mortals are relatively safe during the
cataclysmic regeneration of the lands outside.  Fortunately this is a rare
event in Asgard, but it's good to know that there is somewhere safe, should
the Creators consider regeneration to be necessary.
  The temple has a high, domed roof, covered with scenes depicting heroic
and glorious events in Asgard's past.

from sweet pastries and pies to warm, crusty rolls stuffed with a spicy
vegetable filling.  A few tables and chairs have been placed on the opposite
side for those patrons who wished to immediately savour their purchases. The
sharp-eyed baker's wife stands behind a counter beaming contentedly, yet
ever alert for those who might choose to become light-fingered.  The baker
bustles in the back room producing the mouth-watering wares displayed on the
shelves.

Scholar's Repose~
This, the south-western part of the Sanctuary Village Square, has long been
known as Scholar's repose. You could be forgiven for thinking that it gained 
its name from the neighbouring academic institutions, the training centre to
the west, and the library to the south. In fact the area was named sometime
before these august establishments were built. It was actually named after a
young apprentice wizard who invariably fell asleep here on his returning from
a binge at the Wilting Horn.

library is constantly growing and contains some most unusual books. Some
of the books are so steeped in magic they have taken on a life of their own
and must be chained to the walls to prevent escape, other inanimate books
are so valuble that they are chained to prevent theft,

{x.....Esoteric street, looking for alternative medicine?.  Maybe crystal
healing or a subtle infusion of aromatic oils? Do you feel a need to have
your karmic balance investigated or maybe your kirillian aura needs a tune up?
Tough luck, there is no one in Asylum who caters to your needs. However, should
the Creators ever feel inclined to let them in, this is where they will most
likely set up shop. For the moment you will have to content yourself with an
art gallery and an alchemist's shop. Esoteric Street continues to the north.

A large area around it has been cleared to accommodate any good-sized crowd
who has come to view a public execution.  You shudder lightly, wondering why
anyone would want to view such a ghastly event.  Off to one side, a
cobblestone building has been placed which would undoubtably house the poor
wretches who are to meet their fate atop that platform and be the sole
attraction for such a gruesome spectacle.

fire in a small fireplace set in a side wall does little to relieve the damp
chill that pervades this room.  A small oval desk and rickety-looking chair
has been provided for the unlucky guard who must keep watch over the residents

a blood-stained warrior being held aloft by grateful villagers, hands joined 
in triumph. You have found the home of Sanctuary Village's Mayor. You can
make your way back to Justice Square to the west.

dignity that pervades this courtroom.  The hardwood floors are free of dirt
and the benches lined up in precise rows have been recently dusted.  Two
tables along with chairs have been placed in front of the benches, separated
by a low railing.  In the front of the room a high desk with a padded chair
has been placed for the judge to use during any court proceeding.  Off to
the left chairs have been enclosed in a box-like structure for those chosen
to sit on a jury.  One lone chair sits close to the judge's bench, while a
small, square platform partially ringed by a railing has been provided for
any poor unfortunate placed on trial here.
