Penefore~
Penefore, eldest of all tree snails regards you with a knowing gaze.

Penefore, the great-grandfather of all tree snails rests here, 
towering over his smaller-and-less-talkative offspring with 
the regal countenance befitting his station. 
             
                 *a booming snail voice rises*
                                      
  "Peace be with you adventurer...at least a little while longer.
I am Penefore: advisor and guide to all who would enter this 
place."  ...the snail is interupted as a slew of wounded adventurers
flee past toward the exit, trailing blood and various body parts.
  "*cough* yeees...as I was saying, I have been stationed here
in order to warn you:
1) you will experience a new kind of spacial awareness once you
   enter.  It happens to everybody so just go with it.
2) don't shadow-walk...the high seraphim will shred you to ground 
   beef if they see you shadow-walking.
3) do NOT kill Penefore.  Baaad things shall befall any who would
   ...erm...ehh..just DON'T.

The lord of the caverns approaches you tentatively...and
drops to his knees before you.  His retinue follows suit.
                               
He gazes longingly at the ring for a moment, and begins:
"Friend, the fact that you have descovered that ring means
that my beloved has fallen prey to the scoundrel Kiiran.
We are presently planning to assault his lair but I fear 
that we will not succeed, since we have no defense against 
Kiirans foul necromancy.  *sigh* I must charge you with 
this task: find Michael's lair in the dead treant which
lies in the eastern jungle. Enter through the mouth.
Then, at the mist-guardian, 'enter grxplictli' to reach
his abode.  We will begin our ground war at once, but we
cannot hope for victory without Michael's guidance.  Please
go to him now."

Michael stands about 5'10" and apart from the trademark onyx skin and 
black-on-black eyes that mark any seraphim, he looks pretty much like an
average human. His hair is close cropped and neat, and he doesn't appear
to have claws or fangs or any of the monstrous appendages that his fellow
seraphim share. He smiles, acknowledging your presence.
"Greetings, friend.  Please make yourself at home.  Help yourself to some
wine if it suits you." He smiles warmly and gestures toward a wine rack.
"You are here for one of two reasons: either you have solved Baal's little
mystery or you have managed to circumvent my mist guardian. Thus, I can
assume that you are competent enough to serve my purposes, at least for now."
He flashes a toothy grin and pours himself a glass of burgundy.
"Let me be brief. I know why you came. The answers you seek are here in my
library. Feel free to browse as long as you like." He smiles again.
"Why don't I just tell you? *chuckle* It is because there is wealth and power
to be gained on this road you have chosen, and I cannot stand to see idiots
wield either. If you are truly worthy, then you will find what you seek."

| I noticed travellers entering and leaving my forest    |
| recently, and pinpointed the exact spot where they     |
| first entered my field of perception: "a bridge".      |
| I sent an assistant to investigate this, and found     |
| that although there was nothing impeding him, he could |
| not cross the bridge. There was something INSIDE him   |
| that caused this. Now, focusing on the "coding"        |
| quality (that's what I call the 1's and 0's that make  |
| up everything around us) of my assistant's IMPULSE to  |
| not cross, I came up with a long string of numbers.    |
| Not being without resources, I compared the numeric    |
| pattern with all known languages and came up with:     |
|                                                        |

| of physics and spellcraft. If I could alter the shell  |
| from within, I would have the power of a god, and      |
| could finally exact revenge on those who killed my     |
| master...and imprisoned me in this place. The ones     |

My Beloved {CSparrow{x,
My scouts have noticed unusual activity amongst Kiiran's
wolf spiders to the south. I think you would be safer in my
caverns. I know you don't like to be underground, but...
It's no longer safe for you here.
                                    Yours,

         A Brief Profile of the High Seraphim Lords
                                                 
In the interest of science, particularly future generations of 
adventurers, I have decided to compose this brief synopsis of the 
physical and psychological characteristics of the Lords of the 
Forest of Seraphim.  So, in no particular order: 
            
Gaebril: Gaebril is about a foot taller then the average man. His 
features are humaniod except for his face: A smooth, featureless
orb. Gaebril flys with the aid of a wing-like membrane that
extends from his anckles to his wrists. Gaebril communicates via
telepathy and is one of the more intelligent of the seraphim.
                              
Kiiran: Kiiran the Wretched is Gaebril's twin brother, though he 
lost his wings in a territorial fight with his sibling. Kiiran 
resides in the southern swamp and is known for his wierd, cruel 
experiments.
            
Gorgon: Gorgon is the biggest, the strongest, and the fastest of
the seraphim. His intelligence is lacking however, and his mind
resembles that of a shark rather then a man. Even still, only
Baal is close to rivaling his strength, and therefore the other
seraphim have always given Gorgon a wide berth.
              
Baal: Noble Baal resembles a huge minotaur. Slower then Gorgon
in combat, he still can rival any seraphim in strength. Baal 
posesses an above-average intelligence by seraphim standards, 
but he often looses this edge in his berserker rage.
                
Sparrow: Sparrow is the quickest and the most dexterous of the 
Seraphim Lords. Her body frame is very human-like, exept for 
her oversized claws and razor-fangs. Her uncanny speed makes 
her the only seraphim who doesn't fear Gorgon's rage, as the 
hulking seraphim lord could never hope to catch her. 
              
Michael: I was blessed/cursed with a simple human physique.
My intellect is such that I honestly consider other sentient
lifeforms to be on a lower level of mental evolution. It sounds
arrogant, I know...but I have spent my entire -life- searching 
the heavans and the earth for an equal...without success. It 
seems that I will always be alone.

Reorx. The young human drilled a hole into our realm,
and rode in on a mighty flying beast. He charged
westward and fought his way to the Cathedral, where
he demanded an audience with the Lord of the Seraphim
(who chooses to remain anonymous). Unfortunately, noone
knows what was said at the meeting. We -do- know that
Tristian and the Master stopped by the swamp briefly 
before leaving our Realm, never to be seen again.
Some accounts of that fateful day tell that Tristian
was ambushed by a great Lich in the swamp, and escaped
only by hurling his Holy Axe at the infernal being.
The story goes on to say that the Lich and the Axe both
sunk to the bottom of the swamp, and Tristian was 
unable to retrieve it before he left with the Master.
It's said that the Lich's name was "Grxplictli", and
only by knowing it's name could an experienced vampire
hunter hope to destroy it. One such hunter visited soon 
after, but disappeared somewhere in the western Jungle.

A sad chain of events has taken place. It seems that
Kiiran has abducted Baal's fiance in order to provoke
the bull-headed Lord of the Caverns to war.
Kiiran knows that Baal will have to bring his entire 
army through Gorgon's territory in order to reach the
swamp. Obviously Kiiran is attempting to play Gorgon
against Baal in hopes of weakening them both.  I fear
that Kiiran's plan is sound, and I sense that Baal's
defeat is inevitable unless I can convince him to 
avoid a full frontal attack. Also, I can't imagine
that Kiiran could resist killing Sparrow once she 
had been captured...Indeed, I fear the worst.

            The Screaming Vortex
                      
A long time ago, the Master ruled all of the land 
with his wisdom and his unmatched power. It was a 
golden age of peace unrivaled in the history of this
world. Nothing truly lasts forever though, and in 
time there came a group of powerful Wizards called
'The Seven' who would combine their strength in
order to ambush the Master while he slept.
Individually, these Wizards were no match for the
Great Master, yet during the battle it became clear 
that even -He- could not repel these repeated blasts
from The Seven. The Master fought valiantly. He 
attacked, dodged, and counterattacked in seven 
directions at once: Defeating all but one of the
aggressors before falling himself. 
The Master was slain by this Last Wizard, and his
eternal spirit was banished to the Screaming 
Vortex, an escape-proof tomb in the center of the
Forest of Seraphim. (the Seraphim are the angels 
of the Master). 
In time the Master escaped, of course, (though he
had to find another to replace him in the Vortex)
and to this day he walks among you all, traveling
under a pseudonym that no seraphim will reveal.

Honored Travellers,
  Recent developments, the greatest of these being the
large hole in this wall, have brought about the arrival
of many new faces to our modest home.
  While the initial bolstering of our food supply was
welcomed by all, it has reached the point where the 
volume of traffic has surpassed even OUR formitable
appetites.  In truth, we are currently gorged from the
meat of travellers before you.
  Thus, speaking on behalf of my brothers and sisters,
I have decided that it would benefit all parties involved
if I were to post this warning:
  While you might not find yourself ambushed by hordes
of Seraphim upon your initial entrance, we wish to stress
that we make no offers of safe passage. Enter at your
own risk.
  Furthermore, it has come to our attention that the 
mortals of this age have learned to violate the plane of
shadows.  We honestly don't know who let the cat out of
the bag, but we find this to be an ABOMINATION.
  Believe me when I say that if we find your weak, spindly
mortal frame tainting the plane of shadow in our presence...
We shall not hesitate to bury you where you stand.
Sincerely,
                           Michael. Scholar, and
                     Steward to the Forest of Seraphim

his son, Tristian, for his 16th birthday. The handle was 
made from steel-reinforced bone and consecreted by the ashes 
of the One Man, at the temple of Danaq. The Blade itself is
a mixture of steel and a mysterious ore that Reorx found 
within a meteorite. After it was forged and annealed, the

axe for thirty days...while FASTING.  This is a...pretty...

{x
The dead treant stands here, confronting the world with a stoic
grimace.  It's clear that it has been deceased for quite a while.  Decaying
eye sockets stare past you.  The gaping mouth, frozen in mid-scream,
illustrates in graphic detail the last moments of the treant's life.

The Screaming Vortex~
{x
The center of this clearing is dominated by a deep-red funnel cloud.  The
vortex seems to suck up what little light was available, screaming and
wailing in agony as it gyrates.  Between hysterical sobs, the thing shrieks
in an incomprehenable language.  Suddenly, in a moment of lucidity, the surreal
entity focuses its attention on the tiny mortal who would interrupt its 
eternal penance.

Boneyard~
{x
It still smells kinda gross...  But not AS gross.  It seems that the
smelly carnage is now down wind.  At any rate, this chamber is piled
waist-high with smooth, polished bones.  All sorts of 'em.  Conveniently
enough, someone took the trouble to shovel a clear path through the bones. 
From the west, the faint pull of some dark energy can be felt.

The Glade~
{x
The buzzzz of flies grows louder...
The sight of this glade would turn most stomachs.  Fortunately, the smell
gives most adventurers an indication of what to expect well in advance.  It
seems that there isn't an inch of earth in sight that isn't occupied by a
corpse or body part.  Gigantic snails with oversized mouthes browse through
the carnage, occasionally tearing a mouthful of flesh with surprising
agility.  A younger snail raises its head and grins, exposing rows of gory
shark-teeth.

The Hole~
{x
A sheer granite cliff rises immediately to the west, with a gryphon
sized hole chewed through it into darkness.  This is the spot where the
legendary son of Reorx layed seige upon the Seraphim, in order to confront
their Master.  He was victorious, but he forgot to plug up the hole in the
cliffside.  Since then, it seems that hundreds of mediocre adventurers have
attempted to enter the land of Seraphim, only to be killed...(or, as of
late, merely disfigured and sent running home)  To the east is the bridge
from which you came.

This section of jungle seems pretty ordinary.  No monsters, no demonic
visages...  There are hardly any mosquitos.  One has to wonder if the lack
of dark energy in this place has anything to do with its apparent serenity.

Michael's Library~
{x
   Michael the scholar reclines in a simple wicker chair, simultaneously
scanning a dozen magical portals which float around him.  Four robed
assistants flip vigorously through four large books that have been placed
around the chair.  Michael appears to be reading them all.  Calmly lifting
a single finger, he gestures that he will see you shortly.  Glancing around
the room, it's clear that this seraphim put some effort into decorating 
his lair.  The shelved chamber walls support thousands of ancient tomes in as
many languages.  The vaulted ceiling, high overhead, has been fitted with
glass panels in the form of a mighty whirlpool.  The familiar hummmm of the
dark energy source cascades down through the glass, bathing the room in
crimson.  A few glowing orbs float above the chair, making for a somewhat
more comfortable reading environment.  Behind the pulsing energy source and
the crackling of old parchment and the quiet scuffling of assistants comes
the chanting of a faint...distant choir.

It's nearly impossible to tell one direction from another in this
awful place.  The nausiating stench...the wierd mosters...the thick
backdrop of fog: It's basically impossible to maintain ones bearings.  
The fact that adventurers must wade through waist-high swamp water 
makes the whole scenario just THAT less cozy. Oh well. I guess leeches
have to eat too.

It's clear why they didn't name this place the "Easilly Navigable
Swamp", or the "Pleasant and Fun-filled Swamp". In fact..."The
Fetid Swamp" is beginning to sound like an optimistic appraisal of
this filthy quagmire. The swamp continues in all cardinal directions.

If you've ever seen the giant turtle's lair from 'Neverending Story',
you've got a basic idea of the aura of hopelessness that permeates
the Fetid Swamp. If you -haven't- seen 'Neverending Story'...well I
guess it's probably for the best. Crummy movie. Two thumbs down.
Anyway, the swamp continues in all cardinal directions.

Somewhere...somewhere in this cursed bog, there's got to be a
hidden treasure, or a secret lair, or -something-. Even one of 
those stupid tree-snails would be interesting at this point.
Instead, there is only mud, quicksand, and the occasional swamp
monster.

Wading through this waist-high mud is starting to take its toll.
The surface of the swamp bubbles as countless altered swamp-
-insects pass by. One cannot help but visualize them, hungrilly 
probing the armor of passing adventurers for the smallest kink.

man has no BUSINESS in that place.'  ...The voice fades into the swamp.

an eliptical portal on the center of each wall.  The portal to the east
bathes the room in dark energy.  In between the gateways are cages of men
and beasts, surrounded by small tables carrying filthy surgical instruments.
Maybe it would be a good idea to leave before the master returns...

shape suggets that a stalagmite and stalagtite grew together
over centuries. Scratching noises, accompanied by the smell
of ammonia and guana seem to come from all directions.

The Bat Cave~
*crunch*
The ground levels off here onto a thick layer of hardened bat
droppings, crunching under the feet of those who pass. From 
overhead comes the amplified and aggravated shrilling of many,
MANY bats. They seem disturbed.

The Bat Cave~

Salvation! Soft light juts from a large man-made hole in the
cavern floor. Warm air exiting the hole carries the scent of
torch-smoke.  The clanking of armor comes from the same direction.
It can't be worse then the bats, eh?

Beyond the fissure, the ground turns into sand. The footprints
have vanished...either through clever concealment or sorcery.
To the north, a passageway wraps around a large stalagmite.
Faint scratching sounds can be heard echoing from the east.

rows of humanoid tracks give testimony that there's <something>.

It's hard not to get annoyed by all these bat droppings. Anyway,
it smells like somebody's cooking something in the small cave to
the east. It smells pretty bad though...I mean...the kind of person

{x
This is one of the famous quicksand traps designed by Kiiran to ensnare
adventurers like yourself.  It's been said that he waits years for 
the corpses to soften before harvesting them.  Yuck.

The Caverns~
{x
The passageway bends here, opening up into darkness. Clicks and
scratches and peeps echo from what sounds like a large, open
cavern to the east.

{x
This circular room serves as a tomb for seven of the
most infamous warlocks in recorded history. Death seems
to have sapped much of thier power, but the dozens of 
skeletons at your feet suggest these lich's still pack 
quite a wallop. For some reason, a holy presence can be 
felt here. Strange...
