You've just stepped into the most unlucky position in the whole of DikuMUD.
The result of such a foolish act should be punished with death, you know.
With an acceleration of approximately 9.82 metres per second per second, you
are now descending the Abyss. What awaits you at the bottom will continue to
be a mystery. Bye Cruel World.

You've fallen, and you can't get up!!!
