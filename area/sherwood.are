The Tall Oak~
Barely visible hand and toe holds help people ascend this huge oak.  It's
width is about as large as a circle of fifteen men joining hands in a
circle.  The branches are full of leaves eclipsing any view of the top.

The Tall Oak~
You are at the top third of the large oak.  The view downwards is halfway
hidden by branches.  A thick moss covers the bark of the tree, save where
there are hand and foot holds.  The moss is suprisingly cool and unslippery,
almost as soft as the down of a baby bird.  The foliage seems to part
slightly as people move up the tree-ladder, and seems to magically close as
people move down.

Little John's Treehouse~
The cabin of Little John has been made a bit bigger than any of the
others in the little tree village, because of his immense size and bulk.  It
is furnished only with necessities, for none of Robin Hood's men are
frivolous: they exist to aid the poor unfortunate people around them.

This is the room Maid Marian uses when she sneaks out of the Castle to

cabins, it is well made, but sparsely furnished.  There is, however a bed in
the corner, yet Marian never spends the night....  So much for her
maidenhood.

The home of Will Scarlet is cluttered with weapons of all sorts.  The
usual cleanliness that is seen about the village is challenged here, because
frankly, Will is a slob!  Clothes are strewn over the weapons which have
been dropped in heaps.  The only reason that this room isn't messier is
because in Robin Hood's city, no one is allowed execesses.

Robin Hood's Treasury~
The treasury of Robin Hood is well hidden from even the villagers that he
protects.  He knows that greed can affect anyone, so he keeps his people
happy and well fed, and they do not wonder where he hides the treasures and
gold he takes away from the rich nobles before handing it back to the poor
and needy.

Inside Friar Tuck's Cathedral~
Despite the grandeur of the outside cathedral, the inside is sparse and
barely furnished.  The only thing of note are the barrels and barrels of
wine poking out from behind the confessional curtains.  Friar Tuck didn't
get the title of "Merry" man for no reason.

A Sheep Pasture~
The sheep pasture is hidden deep in the Sherwood Forest.  A well-made
wooden fence keeps the sheep from roaming back into the forest.  The grass
is long and thick and there are troughs of food hinged on the lattices of
the fences to keep the sheep fed at all times.
