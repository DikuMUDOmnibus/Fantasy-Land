Nairod and Nalliw

Much has happend in my life since we fought side by side in the troll war.
I hope, sometime, to have a chance to talk with you about the many pleasant
things.

My purpose now,sadly, is to ask my corageous comrades to aid my people in a
time of dire need. I cannot even describe to you the danger that threatens
Enalro, for I know not its true nature. I do know that unless it can be
stopped, this evil will consume my village and its families. We will vanish
without trace into the dust of history.

A sinister force is at work here, and it is made the more frightening by
the fact that its true nature is concealed in a web of fear and suspicion.
I plead with you, come to Enalro, lend your skills to revealing this menace,
that it may finally be destroyed.

                                   Your comrade,
                                   Zachius Ormo
