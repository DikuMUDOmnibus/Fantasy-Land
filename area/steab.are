Wench~
Wench~
The waitress, Wench, leans over and asks you for your order.
~
Sexy doesn't begin to describe Wench.  The only one who knows this
fantastic feline's real name is Jorinth, and by the glint in his eyes, he's
not telling.  When Wench moves, eyes turn.  The tail swishes behind her
gracefully, and her hips sway in an opposite direction.  Her white fur is so
thin that you barely notice it, and her hair is so full that it covers most
of the two pointed ears at the top of her head.  She is exotic, and many
proposition her.  Few get the answer they desire.

Jorinth Durendal, the Proprietor~
Jorinth, the Proprietor~
Jorinth grants you the crooked smile of a rogueish proprietor.
~
White hair and pale, almost colorless blue eyes dazzle you with his
obvious sense of humor.  He looks you, grins, and is full of energy, but
something in his eyes speaks of secrets and age.  Nobody can tell how old
Jorinth is, but they all have rumors.  He wears a teal tunic with a black
belt, and a thin silver chain.  Flipping the glasses (and liquor) is a
specialty of his, and he never spills.  He's a clown, a barkeep, and a
friend for all.

His russet hair hangs loose around his sleeping face.  His right arm is

that there's been some minor successes.  You'd never think anyone would wear
an outfit that loud.  The pimples break out all over the kid's face, lending
an almost comical look to the scene.

Elbwyth the Fire Adept~
Elbwyth peers coldly at you, waiting for your move.
~
This arrogant man tosses his head haughtily, eats his food with pride and
snobbery, and even pees insouciantly.  He's rude, but he's earned the right.
He's got power behind him, and that's enough to ignore his attitude.  He's
medium-sized, got silver hair, and black eyes which seem to send shivers
down your spine.

A baby dragon wants to play with you. Better run.

This er - little?  - dragonlet peers at you playfully.  Unfortunately,
dragon play isn't so innocent.  Or so save.  The scales are a beautiful
array of colors glistening with the oil the apprentices risk life and limb
(and sanity) to rub into them.  Their fangs and breaths are even deadlier.

Depra are unusual beasts.  Though they look like miniature deer, they

through it unless it's sharpened recently.  The inside of the fangs is
acidic, for their self-preservation, and their meat is particularly juicy. 
This one grazes - on the mice and other small creatures in the field.

beard seems to fit his image, the way a slinking walk does a seductress's
life.  He whistles when he works, and calls to his "mateys" never seeming
down, never seeming upset - except when he's had too much rum, and feels
like a fight.

YEEE gods!  Crabs should never GROW this big!  You'd better be hungry if

This is a giant squid...you begin to wonder if all the fish are this big in these parts.

Tentacles are everywhere you look.  It's amazing how many these fish
have.  You have no time to speculate on how this colossal calamari would
taste, however, because it looks as if it's already decided on how to spice
YOU!

A pirannha darts around in the ocean...out of its element? Odd.
~
For some odd reason these oceans have fish that are never seen in salt
water.  Maybe they're not normal?  The answer to the size question is here,
though.  These pirannha are tiny, though just as viscious as ever.  Maybe
you should take care.

gown~
This gown is gorgeous and expensive.  The forest green material hangs
over the hoop in soft pleats, rippling down until it reaches the floor.  The
bottom hem is gathered in even areas, pinned to the higher portion of the
skirt by golden brooches.  The front part of the dress parts to show the
under-skirt, which is a soft black and gold hatch-pattern.  This pattern and
material is used for the front portion of the bodice, and on the inside of
the sleeves, which hang down to the mid-thigh.  The rest of the bodice is
snugly fit around the torso, tied tightly in the back by gold and black
laces.  The puffed sleeves are echoed by a high back collar which rolls
softly at the top of the neck, just below the cranium.  The front neckline
is boxed, and pushes the breasts up to enhance the cleavage..  The hem of
the bodice is a layer of boxed greens over boxed black and gold, offset
half-way so they both show simultaneously.  All trim is in black and gold,
to finish the complete look of this very rich Lady's Gown.

The Well of Steabean Gods is a spectacular sight.  Each of the seven
corners is decorated with an intricately carved stone statue of one of the
seven deities.  Each statue has a place within it where a small object could
be fit.  It's free of dirt, entirely, and a sweet scent drifts up from its
depths.  There are many legends associated to the Well of Steabean Gods. 
One of them speaks of the possibility of summoning the deities themselves,
though if it is possible, it hasn't happened in over two hundred centuries. 
All in all, it's a spectacular tourist sight.

The Courtyard~
This courtyard is made of close-fitting stones which have been smoothed
and cleaned to a brilliant white.  Several trees line the courtyard, some
recognizable, some not.  One tree possesses a golden-hued trunk, and leaves
that you'd swear were carved of emeralds.  This tree stands to the west,
leading towards Tethyr Pass.  To your north, you see the Purple Elf Tavern
and Inn, but oddly, you hear no sounds coming from the building.  To your
east, you hear the sounds of the ocean in the distance.

The Purple Elf Bar and Inn - Bar Area~
You are nearly blown out the door by the dramatic shift in volumes.  What
you might have thought to be a dead bar, when seen from the outside, you now
discover to be filled with life.  Musicians singing on and around the stage
to the west, a sleepy customer coming down the east stairs, and the barkeep
getting a message from the kitchen behind the bar.  Everywhere you go are
tables and people of all races imaginable, and some you've never believed
could be.  Just as you regain control of your senses, you find yourself led
to a table, and abandoned there.

Antyr Way~
Noises abound from the north.  The voices scream out their wares, and
children squeal with joy.  People bargain, cajole, and joke there.  It is
the main marketplace of Antyr City.  To the east, the sounds of the ocean
grow louder, and a faint touch of salt is in the air.

The Vault~
GOLD!  You see gold, gems, treasure!  You're rich!  Rich!  Richer than
midas!  You're so happy, you can't wait to get back to the bank and deposit
it.  Hm.  That's odd - you did come down a door, didn't you?  Ah, well. 
Maybe you can recall and go to the bank there.  HEY!  No!  You're stuck! 
Help!  HELP!  I'm rich!  I can pay my way out.  Is the air getting less in
here?  Am I suffocating?  Maybe I can kill myself?  No.  There *has* to be a
way out somehow, right?  
At least, you can hope.

The Heart of Stone~
For being under the dark forest, this room is very light.  It's a cave,
of sorts, lined with ferns, food, and some small animals and birds.  In the
center of this "clearing" is a large pink stone with a thin crack from the
top to bottom.  Against the stone sleeps a man, dressed in a Harlequin's
black and white.  The birds and animals seem to watch you expectantly,
waiting to see what you will do.

The Purple Elf - Kitchen~
The cacophany from the pots and pans that get thrown at the assistants
blasts your eardrums.  In the center of the well-organized mess is the
ringleader...  Who moves like a blur from pot to pot.  The smell's divine. 
You'd never imagined that such a mess could make such beautiful smells.  And
more, that a dwarf would be a chef, let alone a good cook.  But it exists.

The Stage~
A rack of instruments hangs on the wall, with various styles of lutes,
flutes, violins, and drums.  You see a neatly-painted sign right above it,
and a stool right in front of it.  The area around the stage is formed into
a small hatshell, projecting the sound wonderfully into the room.  As you
glimpse down at the smooth wooden floor, you notice a thin line - perhaps
the outline of a secret door?

Thieve's Guild~
This room nearly blinds you, as it's so bright compared to the darkness
you just came from.  In the middle of the room is a large oak desk, and
standing behind that is the nastiest, coldest, most mysterious man you've
ever seen.  But then, you don't see much of him.  His eyes are shadowed by
the flat hat he wears, his clothes are all black, save a teal belt, and a
silver chain, and he's half-way hidden by the desk.  Not much else is in the
room, but you feel a thousand eyes measuring you up and down.  You see doors
around you, you think.  They all seem hazy against the walls, however, so it
might be a good idea to "feel" your way.

Guild Holding Cell~
"Close every door to me.  Keep all the world from me.  Bar all my
windows, and shut out the light."  You find yourself humming a haunting tune
of melancholy in this dank cell.  A candle is the only light, the hungry
rats the only sound.

Training Room~
This place reeks of sweat.  Everywhere you look is training equipment. 
Ropes are attached to walls and ceilings for climbing practice and
muscle-building, there are locks against one wall for picking practice, a
wall with some rough edges for more climbing practice, not to mention
several hurdles and weights.  One thing you can assure yourself of here, you
will be trained...  Or Dundar, the Training Master might take you as his
personal "project."  And looking at Dundar, you know that's not a good
thing.

This long hallway has many doors in it, but most of them are impossible

such means as only a Master Thief could create.  You get a tingling feeling
that the traps are even worse.  You do, however find three doors that are
easily opened - and one that, with work, might be convinced to come ajar. 
They can be found to the north, west, and south.  The locked one is above
you.

Commoner's Bedroom~
This room's not for one person.  Several beds line the walls, with
blankets, nighttables, and chests for each.  A person who hasn't much money,
but desires to sleep indoors can pay a fair price for one of these beds, and
stay here quite happily.  Curtains surround the areas, for a hint of
privacy, and it seems to be fairly comfortable - for a bargain-rate bedroom.

Those who stay here have money, though no titles.  The bed is a comfortable
creation of down and straw, and has several layers of soft blankets.  The

The rug is beautiful, woven with intricate skill by loving hands.  The
greens and the blues of the noble lady's dresses enliven the scene, as do

rear pouch of a merchant.

Noble's Bedroom~
Every luxury is within this room.  The coloring is in regal hues of deep
purple, from the satin sheets to the plush carpeting.  The furniture's of a
light wood, trimmed and decorated with the same hue of deep purple, and some
gold leaf.  The chandelier that brightens the room sends patterns to
interlock with the filigree on the posts of the canopy bed, and the rope
that dangles beside that bed is decorated with a gold thread.  Everything
you see in this room bespeaks of great wealth and pampering.

out for brief moments.  The soft sound of puttering feet and the stale scent
of old parchments seem to cling to the air itself.  The stones around the
base of the tower seem blackened and charred, for some odd reason.

This room is fraught with the remnants of failed magical experiments.  No
amount of scrubbing will remove the char-marks from the room.  Nothing will
clean up the green stains on the floor.  And that odd pile of dried-out
stringy stuff might have once been an octopus or a hydra.  One could never
tell, now.  To the north you see an open door, and several young students
practicing - often on each other.

been scrubbed (probably by the newer apprentices.)  The lighting is good,
save for the occassional "dark" caused by something above you.  When you
look up, you see the heads of small dragonlets.  Some grin down at you.  You
begin to shudder, until you see one bump its nose on an invisible force. 
You're safe - you hope.

Alchemical Laboratory~
Long tables span the room lengthwise, some with bowls of water, many
glass bottles, and other items of experimentation, while others are more
bare.  Shelves hold jars with neat lables on them.  There are small
fire-pits in the walls at even intervals, with wood, water, and sand next to
them.  One table holds several scrolls weighted open by four small stones.

Practice Room~
This room REEKS of magic.  It reeks of sweat.  It just plain stinks.  You
gasp and hold your hand over your mouth, worrying if the stench will cling
to your clothes.  Such a physical form of magic seems impossible to believe
- until you see the form moving towards you.

Quarters to the Adept, Elbwyth~
One would expect the private quarters of a mage so powerful as Elbwyth to
be lush and lavish, but this is not.  One would expect a mage as powerful as
Elbwyth to be ancient, but he is not.  One would expect a mage as powerful
as Elbwyth to be arrogant, cynical, and insulting as possible, but - well,
he is.  The room you look at is bare of decorations of any kind.  A simple
cot, desk, ad mirror are the only furniture.  Elbwyth sits at his desk
writing on a scroll.  When you enter, he stands to face you, and waits for
you to speak or attack.

between the stones.  When you go to touch it, however, it shies away from
you.  Sentient flowers: New concept?

Temple of Antyr - Grand Worship Hall~
The main hall of the temple is a great circular room with a dome on the
top.  A mural has been lovingly done on this dome, depicting six deities
(one which is a middle-aged woman) pulling portions of land from each other.
The artist's name is illegible, but you do catch the title of the mural as
being "The Great Rift."  Stairs take you up to some cubicles, and a chute
takes you down.  Exits lead into cubicles on the west, north, and south, and
back outside to the east.

This room drips with beauty and nature.  The donation bowl is really a

the room.  Ferns wave and create a gentle breeze, and you sense the feeling
of peace and life.  The nurturing found in the Goddess of Nature's cubicle of
worship leaves you no doubt as to why she's known as the "Mother of the

that surround you, there rises a bright image of a flaming bird: The
Phoenix.  Around the edges of the cubicle are plants, various kinds of
flowers.  Next to the pots of plants are small dishes, with seeds placed in
them.  Also placed in the seeds are small notes, parchments, and pebbles
with writing on them.

You hear the sounds of the sea when you're standing in this cubicle, and
feel the winds blowing against your skin.  Shells are placed in strategic
places, alongside weapons of all sorts.  The donation pit is shaped as a
large golden sheath, and it's obvious thieves have tried (notice: Tried) to
take it before.  Legend has it that when the sheath of Romiere in Antyr
falls, she will die, and War will take over the lands.  It's unknown if the
Goddess kills the fools who try for it or if the people who catch them do,
but either way, it's never come down.

You've entered the library.  No, this is not the library, this is the

growling at any who enter, but allowing all to pass.  A single chair sits in
the corner of the room, with a pad in front of it.  A bowl rests next to the
pad, where donations are placed.  Donations tend to be literature, or poems.
It's been said that favored followers have knelt before the chair, and been
rewarded by seeing the black-haired deity appear in the chair to impart some
knowledge.

This room is usually red, unless Shastromm, Goddess of Chaos, lust, and

one of her "moods."  Which is often.  Unless it's his mood.  Which happens,
when she - er - he - er - whatever feels like it.  Which is often.  The
floor is lined with throw pillows and cushions (usually), and bath oils and
scents are scattered all around.  Shastromm doesn't take money as donations.
Nor do her clerks.  They prefer more - intimate pay.  
Usually.

In the darkness, a blind old woman spins on her wheel.  You think you see
little golden eyes peering around at the ground level, but you can't be

and the bed, which is a lumpy hay contraption, seems as if it might be home
for more than just the woman.  You'd lay bets on lice, bugs, and other
mites.  It makes you ill just looking at it.

Upon entering this luxuriously plush room, you get a great feeling of

trying to welcome you to the Parlor, to the food, to the drinks - to them. 
The Madame rests on an elegant love-chair, and behind her hangs a picture of
the most-loved Goddess of this establishment - Shastromm.  In fact, rumors
have it she's loved here often - but how much can you believe rumors? 
There's a waiting room to your south, and rooms to the north, east, and one
you reach by climbing up a gentle-sloping staircase in the back.

How does your lover rate?
1) When people describe you and your lover do they say you are:
   A) Joined at the hip
   B) So CUTE together
   C) Like oil and water
 
2) Does your lover lie when they say they didn't overspend?
 
3) Does your lover need batteries?
 
4) Does your lover ditch you for your brother or sister when you bring them home to meet the family?
 
5) Does your lover leave the chewing gum on the bedpost overnight?
 
Answers: 
1) If you answered A) give yourself 2 points. If you answered B) Give yourself 1 point. If you answered C) Tough luck! Time for a new lover!
 
2) If you answered "Yes" Give yourself a point. If you answered "No." Work harder at those guilt trips!
 
3) If you answered "Yes" It's DEFINITELY time for a new lover. If you answered "No" give yourself 1 point.
 
4) If you answered "Yes" It's too bad, that ain't your lover. If you answered "no" Be happy and give yourself 1 point.
 
5) If you answered "Yes" Ditch the lover, that's disgusting! If you answered "No" give yourself 1 point.
 
0 - 1 Why are you with this lover?
2- 3 It's an "OK" relationship, but your lover needs work.
4 - 5 Going strong! Lover rates well!
6 Now THAT's a passionate relationship!

Private "Guest" Room~
Lavish is the best way to describe this room.  In one part of it, you see
a soft table with warm towels lain out next to it.  Another part of the room
has a shelf with various spices and oils.  Incense is placed next to a
burner, and a few simple musical instruments rest on a table beside you.  A
rope with a tassle hangs by the soft table, and it makes you wonder what it
does.  When your curiousity gets the better of you, you tug it, and hear a
distant bell.  Soon after someone comes in with more warm towels, and
disappears as silently.

You step into this room and feel down.  Feathery-soft, the down is
scattered on the floor.  Several hooks hang from the ceiling, and from
those, hung by loops, are every type of feather imaginable from all around
the world.  Some you recognize, some you don't, but all, you would suspect,
would tickle you past the point of tears.  There are also stocks in here, to
put people while they're being tickled.  It's all-in-all an innocent, silly
way to pass the time, but there's no accounting for taste.  Or style,
either.

Forest of Rhythym~
You are entering the legendary Forest of Rhythym.  Within these woods it
is said the "Heart of Stone" is hidden.  This Heart is cherished as the
origin of all beat, all rhythym.  It's been carefully guarded since the
Rift, for fear that all Rhythym would end should it break.  This includes
the rhythym of breathing, heartbeats, and of walking.  Long ago, another
legend tells, there was a great fire in a city outside of Antyr.  This City
no longer exists, but the survivors, men known as "The Knights of Revels"
escaped.  Many fought when they discovered there was a ruse, and that it was
arson, save one.  That one retained his power long enough to find the Heart
of Stone - cracked.  In trying to fix it, he fell into a deep sleep.  That
Legend says the last Knight of Revels, Corwyn Tormyr, waits somewhere in
this forest for the next generation of heros to wake him, and help him heal
the forest.  All in all, though, the Forest seems a silent, spooky place.

Forest of Rhythym~
No sound at all surrounds you.  The silence overwhelms all but the

Steab South Wharf~
You're standing on the rickety wharf, frightened it might give way. 
Attached to several poles are small rowboats, used to transport people to
and from the huge rigs out on the main ocean.

Shallow Waters~
These waters are deep enough for the small boats, but shallow enough for
the water to be light.  Small sea critters sometimes get stuck here, but are
soon fished out and either cooked up, or returned to deeper waters.
