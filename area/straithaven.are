A holy rune~
Four giant pillars stand in each corner of this trail.  A large
altar made of marble stone stands in the middle of the trail. 
Four tall torches inside a large glass stand around the altar.
A strange stone embedded encryption of holiness is made on the
ground before the altar.  The trail carries north and south here.

A trail north and south~
At this trail are tall statues of great heros from the former Aadaria.
Small flames are surrounded alongside the trails inside small sand-filled
vases.  The ground is strangely made with marble.  To the north
the trail lingers while to the south the trail that way makes a
slight descent.

A trail north and south~
A large statue of a bearded man in an overworn cloak stands at
the center of the trail here.  The open wide is seen to the left
and to the right.  Distant hills can be seen to the north and south.
All is open and quiet here.

A trail north and south~
The trail lingers on to the north and the south here.  A steady
breeze flows about as the trail slightly climbs northward and southward
almost in a slight bump.

A trail north and south~
As the trail southward makes a steadily climb, the path to the
north again makes a slight descent.  The unusual essence of this
long road going two ways makes it a bit mysterious.  The open wide
that continues on to the north steadily becomes more visible as
faint greeneries can be seen from afar.

Before a strange gate to the north~
A large gate about 25 feet high stands before you.  The strange
enchanted creation of this gate looms.  The unusual nature of this
gate is that it serves no purpose amongst a long road that goes
north and south.  To the north the open wide begins to close as
trees and shrubs of various dead leaves scatter.  More of the wider
scenery is to the south where the straight path meanders up and
down that way.

A large gate about 25 feet high stands before you.  The strange
enchanted creation of this gate looms.  The unusual nature of this
gate is that it serves no purpose amongst a long road that goes
north and south.  To the south the open wide makes a dip but the
wide open is still visible that way.
