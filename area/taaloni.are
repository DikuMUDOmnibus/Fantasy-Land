The Volcano~
A narrow bridge of stone is all that spans the great crevasse that stands
in front of you.  The bridge is only wide enough for one foot to fit in
front of the other.  A great pit of fire looms beneath you.  There is a
swirling sea of molten rock waiting to swallow you up.  One wrong move means
most certain death.  Exits lead to the south and west.

well.  The heat has not lessened in the least.  At least there is no lava
flowing across the tunnel floor.  Exits lead north and down.

plumes of ash and smoke into the air.  A huge chunk of the mountain falls
away.  A river of molten rock pours forth onto the peaceful forest below. 
Everything it touches bursts into flames almost instantly.  There is no hope
of escape now.
