This wide dirt path is lined by large wooden logs.  Very smooth and quite
clean, this path looks to be well maintained regularly.  The sweet smell of
pine and the chirp of the occasional bird surrounds you with a sence of
peace.  To the north stands a large stone structure resembling a castle of
sorts.

language but many.  Knowledge is another path to enlightenment, and these
monks study and pore over huge tomes while teachers move among them giving
pointers.  To the north start the bedrooms of the monks.

The walls of this room are lined with weapons of all sorts.  From plain
wooden staves to ornate scimitars.  Here the students study the weapon and
learn everything about every weapon.  The more they learn to anticipate the
weapon, the easier it is to not get harmed by the weapon.  A students best
weapon is his mind and body working as one, but sometimes a weapon is a
nessesity and they are trained occordingly.

Looking around, you see people working, flowers, and green bushes as far
as the eye can see.  Looking up you are nearly struck by the biggest
butterfly you have ever seen.  All sorts of butterflys move here and there
attracted by the sweet scent of the flowers.  Bending down to sniff at a
large rose bush is heavenly as you inhale deeply.  To the north is a
fountain formed into the shape of a tiny waterfall that feeds the natural
irigation of these plants.

blossoms and standing over five feet tall.  Buzzing around here are a
multitude of bees moving lazily from bush to bush.  Many people bustle

backbreaking but the effort is well worth every second.

to every plant in the garden.  The water is fresh and the sound of it
flowing over the small rocks and hand fashioned cliffs is soothing.  Several

scent of fresh water and citrus.

Darkened Cell~
This cell is dark and damp and the floor is covered with a strange slimey
substance.  The only light cast beyond that of your torch is the flickering
light of a tiny fairy, closed within chains and looking very pathetic.  Such
a marvelous creature reduced to such a state makes your heart ache.

Magical Rip in Reality~
This strange rip in reality is caused by the massive swell of energy
Belmakor commands.  All around massive ribbons of color swirl and eddy in an
endless dance.  Its amazing the control over the magical fabric this being
holds, he is content to dwell in such chaos.  The magic dances to his
delight and none of the magical backlash harms him.  Dont be fooled, such
energy can spiral out of control and kill a lesser mortal.
