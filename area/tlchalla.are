A Path to a City~
A wide dirt path heads towards some sort of city.  All around the path,
undergrowth springs up and animals dart to and fro, across the path and
around it.  The trees are quite thick on either side but they appear to thin
out towards the east as the land becomes more flat.  A fresh breeze stirs
the air and with it come the sounds of citylife.  There is a SIGN posted
beside the road here.

{$Outside the Gates of Tolchalla{x~
These are the western gates of the port city known as Tolchalla.  You can
smell the briny sea air, drifting over the city from the sea on the eastern
side.  The large black marble gates loom over you and have been carved with
several large arcane symbols, possibly to protect the city from raiders. 
The path leads away from the city to the west and into the city itself to
the east.

{$Inside the West Gates of Tolchalla{x~
You are standing inside the west gates of Tolchalla.  AS you look east,
you see the splendor of the city stretch out before you.  Merchants and
sailors are the main population of the city, so you see a whole lot of big
burly men, and prissy looking ones in fine clothes.  Being fairly new,
Tolchalla is very bright and gaudy looking.  Signs to different bars, and
shops are all painted in bright colors to attract the eye.  West is outside
the gates and east is Sword Street.

You are walking down a street in the city of Tolchalla.  This is
obviously a very rich city, for all the buildings are nicely painted in
bright, and sometimes ostentatious colors.  Merchants in fine clothes and
golden rings, sniff at you as you walk by, and large burly men, obviously
sailors, push past you in a most unfriendly manner.  West is near the gates,
and Sword Street continues east.  North and south are shops.

You have walked into a small, yet seemingly rich shop.  Wooden shelves
filled with pamphlets and books about the city of Tolchalla are against
almost all of the walls.  A large oak counter is at the north end of the
room.  It has all kinds of maps and pictures of land marks in the city.  A
small man, who you wouldn't want to be alone with in a dark alley, is
standing behind it.  The only exit is south, to Sword Street.

underneath the posters, holding all sorts of trinkets and replicas of
statues and such.  T'shirts and tunics with witty remarks asbout the city
hang from hangers in the back.  The only exit is North back to Sword Street.

You are walking along Sword Street.  This street is obviously heavily
commercialised.  Bright signs advertise all sorts of products and shops,
easily catching the eyes of tourists and merchants alike.  Small shops stand
side by side and in some places, bars and taverns have sprung up.  Music
jangles dischordantly from the north and loud explosions can be heard from
the south.  The street continues to the east and west.

This is a strip joint.  Tantalising music is played by musicians on
flutes and guitars.  A bar is almost hidden away in the corner of the room,
but serving the only drink which seems to be needed here, beer.  A stage
stands at the opposite end of the room where the girls dance, removing their
clothing as they gyrate.  Sailors and merchants are obviously having a good
time as their eyes don't leave the girls.  The exit is to the south, to
Sword Street.

This is a small dusty little shop which looks like it has been in town a
lot longer than any of the others.  Shelves are filled with scrolls, wands,
spell books and staves and reach from floor to ceiling and against every
single wall save that of the exit.  A cat with two heads and green fur sits
on the counter and watches you suspiciously.  An old man potters around the
back of the counter as if searching for something he lost years ago.  Sword
Street lies to the north.

You are walking down a narrow paved street.  Horses and carts move down
it, filled with produce and goods to sell, making muttering people move to
the side.  This part is so narrow, that there are no shops on it.  Merchants
and burly sailors push past you, obviously in a hurry to get some place. 
The street continues east and west.

Intersection~
This is the intersection between Sword Street and Dragon Street.  It is
quite a busy place as it leads to the main areas in the town.  A cityguard
stands right at the centre keeping an eye on people.  Carriage drivers yell
at each other to move out of the way, adding to the stress and bustle of the
location.  Sword Street continues east and west whilst Dragon Street runs
north to south.

bars and taverns.  A few shops can also be seen, among all the other
buildings.  South is an intersection and Dragon Street continues north.

screams.  Sometimes you'll see a thief or two run down the street after a
successful robbery.  Some hired thugs in weird leather outfits also grace
this area of the street.  This is all probably because Shadow Street is to
the north.  Vendrini Street continues east and west, while south is some

other types of food.  The only exit is south, back to Vendrini Avenue.

Yervanas's Dragon Cuisine~
You have entered an incredibly large restaurant, but its gotta be that
way.  Since dragons are at least twenty feet high.  The tables are enormous,
almost too big to measure with a tape measure.  The menu is really gross
too, theres goblin meat, dwarf meat, and quikling meat to name a few.  The
resurant owner stands behind the counter picking his teeth, maybe you better
leave if your not a dragon.  The only exit is north, back to Vendrini
Avenue.

Mudrak's Tavern~
You have entered an incredibly run down old tavern.  The walls are made
of rotting wood, and seem like they could fall in, at any moment.  Pictures
of sailing ships and the sea hang from them on rusty nails.  The bar stools
are cracked, and some have even fallen over.  The counter looks like more
knife than one has been stuck in it during a bar room brawl.  Tons of
sailors and thieves sit on the broken stools, drowning their sorrows in ale.
The only exit is east, back to Shadow Street.

Dragon Street~
You are walking down Dragon Street.  The road is made of smooth pebbles
so you don't cut your feet.  Bright colored signs in neon lettering
advertise shops and bars that you might want to go to.  Buildings are lined
up neatly along the side of the road, probably the very ones the signs are
announcing.  Crowds of people push past you to get whereever they are going.
Dragon Street continues north and south, while shops are east and west.

carved with arcane symbols which supposedly protect the city from evil.  You
can smell the salty sea air as you get farther away from the gates. 
Tolchalla is a prominent port town, a place where merchants and sailors are
the main population.  You can see Dragon Street to the south, and north is

You have entered a small pawn shop.  This is where the poor people of the
city pawn off their possessions for money in order to pay off debts and
such.  The walls are painted a tacky neon pink, and the carpet is an even
tackier plaid.  All kinds of trinkets and items are laid out on shelves,
each with signs saying what they are by them.  The owner, a sleazy looking
fat man, asks you what you want to buy or sell.  The only exit is south,

in swirling shadows and holy light.  It is made of pure black granite and pure
white marble.  Every once in awhile a large ball of lightning will come from
the heavens and strike somebody walking by the tower.  This particular
building isn't exactly the safest place to work or even be near.  South is

proclaim big name restaurants, bars, and shops.  Large crowds of people walk
neck and neck, trying to get to different places, almost in a sort of race. 
Sometimes a carriage or a cityguard will ride by, making everyone grudgingly
move out of the way.  You are close to the docks, so the smell of the sea,
really starts to feel your nostrils and your eyes are starting to feel the
salty sting.  East is the docks and Sword Street runs west.  North and south
are shops.

the sting of the salty sea air lifts your spirit up.  The docks are made of
wooden baords, glued together with tar and sealed with some wood paint, so
they don't get destroyed by the salty sea.  If you look over the side of the
docks, you can see the icy waters of the sea.  The waves lap over up to the
side of the docks, but rarely get large enough to hit you.  West is Sword
Street and the docks continue north.

see, there is a forge behind the shop counter, where a small dwarf is
banging away at a piece of metal, forging it into a weapon.  Finished
weapons brightly shine, as they hang from metal hooks, allowing you to see

even though the rest of the city is having a sunny day.  There are some
carving on the black oynx walls, which are usually of weird angelic or
demonic faces.  Up continues your hellish trek, and north is back to the

Tolchalla.  You must be up at least one thousand feet, so you better be
careful not to fall.  Two turrets are east and west.  They house the guild's

tables on the east and west walls with a candle on each of them.  This
creates a soft lighting in the hallway, just enough to see your key to open
your room door.  Maids scurry between rooms, fixing them up for the next
customers.  All the cardinal directions lead to rooms in the Inn.

{$Tolchalla National Bank{x~
You have entered the Tolchalla National Bank.  The walls are nicely
painted a rich green color, and the floor is made up of granite tiles.  A
painting of the founder of the bank is mounted up on the doorway.  Four
windows, each with bank tellers standing behind them, are at the north end
of the bank.  Lines are at each of the windows, so it might be awhile till
you can actually withdraw or deposit anything.  The only exit is south, back
to Vendrini Avenue.

gray, and have pictures of happy owners with their adoring pets.  There is a

filled with pets that cry out for an owner, or just for their freedom.  The
only exit is east, back to Dragon Street.
