sword~
The blade of the sword is a full meter long and straight as an arrow, with
lightly-fluted sides.  Both edges are keened down to perfect lines, invisibly
sharp.  Perfection like this could have only been forged by a god.  The black
hilt is contrasted only by the faint symbol of a white arrow.
Upon the blade is engraved a poem:

                      Farslayer howls across the world
                      For thy heart, for thy heart, who hast wronged me!
                      Vengeance is his who casts the blade
                      Yet he will in the end no triumph see.

fall from your body.

bodies and tortured souls seem to be the main theme of the art. Bright reds
and hot blues are enphasized throughout the mural. As you stare at it the
characters within it seem to move and struggle in pain. The hot air around
you smells of sulfur and methane. To the south you see a stone hallway.
Hot air blows in at you from the doorway. The air stirs up the methane and

chained. The firewalls seem to move in patterns that leave the poor
people directly in the path of the oncoming fire. The walls seem to creep
ever so slowly towards them. The people blister and scream as the fire gets
closer. Their deaths seem like minutes of agony and pain, and even as they
burst into flames they seem incapable of grasping the merciful attention of
death...

you're out of luck. But then again...if you are in Hell...you must've run

Some are recognizable and some are not. Rumor has it that Stanley made
a deal with a devil....so I guess his lease is up in seven years.....
