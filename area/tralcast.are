tralfin castle guard~
the Tralfin Castle guard~
The Inner Tralfin Castle guard stares blankly at you.
~
A behemoth of a man he stands stone still, not even blinking an eye.  His
worn and dusty armor speak of much use, with much negligence.  For a guard
he seems totally unaware of your presence.  As you look closer, you see his
eyes are vacant, only those with no wit at all are caught for his boring
duties.

fact that he has not had the chance or time to sleep.

The blacksmith~
Dollon tends to his blacksmithing.
~
Dollon's hands are heavily scarred with old burns and cuts.  Despite this
appearance of carelessness his work has always been the best that anyone could
find.  The burns are there because he ignores the heat as if it doesn't effect
him at all.  Not a drop of sweat beads on his forehead.

The castle tanner, Jeblie, smells as bad as his hides.

His hands are dyed a mottled color from years of working with the chemicals and

A sly royal guard~
One of the sly royal guards of the castle looks at you with contempt.
~
One of the elite guard, separate from the normal castle warriors and guards,
he has found his way here by devious manners.  A little pull from the right
people and he has a cushy job, although he can fill it well.  This fellow
looks as if he hasn't eaten in weeks, but is still alert and ready.  He is
one step from knight hood, and knows it.

The general is fuming.  He and the king had almost worked out an alliance
against some mutual foes when all of this happened.  What an untidy bit of a
mess it has been.  Just when he is about to complete his mission and return
home, the king stops talking to him and the service gets really bad.  He is
debating whether he is being kept prisoner or not but it makes little
difference since he can't return home till his mission is done.  Death here
or death there for an uncompleted order, not much of a choice.

The guard barracks lie directly to the north.  This is their entryway into
the hallway that circles the castle within the outer hall.  A small torch
gutters in the wall casting eerie shadows both directions down the hall.
There isn't, however, enough light to really make out what lies in either
direction.

A set of narrow stone steps leads to a small trapdoor above.  The steps are
scarred and gouged from the fall of many heavy boots upon them over a long
period of time.  No lichens grow there, they are too well used for that.
Narrow hallways run north and west through the walls.

You stand inside a huge room.  Apparently this area is used for the common

Large rough plank tables are set about the room here and several more are
leaning against the wall if more are needed.  A peat fire is glowing in the
center of the room, heating even the far corners.  To the west you see more
tables and to the north sits a small dais such as musicians would be seated
on.  To the south a small hallway runs inside the castle's walls.

and warmth, but from the things you see around you it has been a good long
time since anyone played here.  A small passageway to the north leads into
the castle wall.  The commoners room extends to the south and west.

smaller but identically made door with a small notch in-between like a
protected area for a guard to stand.  All three have similar looking
keyholes.  Glancing up you see a number of small holes in the ceiling.
>From the black greasy traces around them, you can assume that hot oils
can come pouring through them at any time.  This would not be a pleasant

Greasy smoke rises from a hot grill.  A pile of gnawed bones and bent
tankards sits to one side.  Huge bugs crawl all over the pile and wall
behind it.  The smell of rotten food pervades the area.  You can see
entrances to the castle both to the north and south.

litter the floor and counters along with wasted bits of food that are in
no condition to be eaten by anything but rats and bugs.  It is a wonder that

there light the entire hall.  You notice a smaller throne to the north.
Tables and finished benches surround you and continue to the west.

brazier casting light and heat throughout the hall.  A beautiful crystal
chandelier hangs from the ceiling, although it remains unlit.  Looking

This stall could hold a number of animals comfortably.  However, more
animals means more waste, and this stall is the filthiest one of all.  The
small amount of rotten straw on the floor has been ground into the thick
muck of animal waste accumulated on the floor.  The wood on the empty trough
and bucket have been gnawed down until they are almost unusable.  The only

Top of the central tower~
You are on top of the central tower.  Looking over the short wall to the
north you can see into the castle yard.  Smoke drifts this way from a small
grill burning there.  The smells of food, some good, some bad, accompany the
smoke.  Looking to the west you see the steeply slanted roof of the castle
proper.  The gap between here and there is too great to jump however.

The short wall that runs around the top of the tower has a small statue of
something sitting on it here.  It looks like it may have been of a human or
humanoid figure but it is too bashed up to make out any details anymore.

You stand directly above the gate.  The view from here is extensive.  You
can see all the roads winding through the moor, the small lake and the
fog bank lifting from the little dell.

There are several arrow racks and a large oil barrel sitting in the corner
empty.  Gazing over the wall to the northeast you face into the cold wind.
Far off the call of a lonely bird drifts in on the wind.

You are directly above the main entrance to the castle yard.  Dropping even
a small rock on someone from here could cause them grave injury, even death.
The short wall and small pile of rocks lying on it show that someone else
had the same idea.

Top of the southwestern tower~
Gazing out over the moor to the west your eye runs down the long cliff
that rises from the moor floor.  At this height you can almost see over and
past it to a hint of blue.  Be it mountains or ocean or plain you cannot
tell from here.

out onto the flooring.  You can continue around the top of the tower to the

The short wall surrounding the top of the tower is crumbled here, as if some
huge force smashed down upon it.  There is no sign of any attempt to repair
the damage.  The strong wind whistles to through the opening making an eerie
sound.  You may continue around the top of the tower to the west and north.

The strong wind blows in from the hole in the wall to the east.  The tracks

comes here often.  You can continue around the top of the tower to the east
and north or return to the tower itself down the ladder.

The clean swept flooring sits in contrast with most of the rest of the castle

to be seen.  Looking out over the moor to the west you see a hint of a river
as the moor turns to woodland.  The tower continues to the east and south.
