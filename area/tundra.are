The air is cold to breathe here as the vegetation surrounding the pathway

Before An Ice Village~
The air is brisk and cool, while gentle flurries descend upon the cold
earth.  A dark mountain stands high beyond the town in this frozen region. 
Guards stand their ground at the gates so still as if they are not even
bothered by the cold.

The Ice Village of Terahm~
What lays ahead is a village composed entirely of ice.  The homes, roads,
and even people are just frozen dopplegangers of a traditional village life.
Little ice children skate about with their frozen toys and even pets.

Village Square~
Here is the center of this icy town.  Cart venders slide by trying to
solicite their trinkets and other goods.  A fountain of a mighty ice dragon
stands tall and surprisingly flows water.

Terahm Potion Shop~
This shop is extremely cold, most likely to keep the potions in good
condition.  The old shopkeeper Abrahn has some cracks under his eyes and
looks like he doesn't want to be disturbed.  He looks every now and then for
possible business, but promptly gets back to his current task.

Path to Dragon Cave~
The village path abruptly ends and now a muddy pathway leads to a large
ice cave in the distance.  All the villagers who look upon this cave shiver
in terror of the Dragon who dwells there, but they also respect the Dragon
as their watcher.  Only the really brave or really stupid dare to tread this
way.

Before the Dragon Cave~
A gigantic ice cave stands tall with a deep hole welcoming new victims. 
Growls, and other eery sounds resinate from the dark hole of the cave.  A
crushed skull lies at the entrance as a sign of the dragon's hospitality to
his guests.

will be sacrificed to the Dragon by use of the magical and highly forbidden
red fire.
