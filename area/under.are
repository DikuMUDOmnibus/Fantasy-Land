A skyzorr'n is a race of insectoid beings.  The skyzorr'n looks rather like a

eyes and fair-sized mandibles.  No ears, as such, are present, but there are
three tiny, well covered holes on either side of the head.  The body is thin
and stick-like.  It has four arm/claw appendages, with reasonably
developed pincer-hands on the two uppermost and dagger-like claws on
the two lower ones.

Home of a Denizen of the Underdark~
You stand in a large home.  There are many rooms, yet nothing of interest. 
The house is lighted by the same glowing orbs that float throughout the
whole city.  There are some weird decorations in the home but nothing to
write home about.

Home in the Underdark~
You stand in a small hovel in the Underdark.  This home consists of three
rooms.  Each of the room serves it's purpose and has nothing else, so the
bedroom has a bed and some storage room.  The dining room has a table
and a cooking device and the third room is the washroom.  Not a very
interesting place.

Chamber of Silence~
You are standing in Silence's relaxation room.  The walls are pitch black
while the floor flows from one colour to another causing weird shadows
and colours to bounce off the walls.  Against the wall is a large map.  On
the south wall stands a large window.

There are no exits from Silence's Chamber.

Corner of Wyrm Street and Sunset~
You stand in the north western corner of the Underdark.  The bustling
streets sound distant and the hum of people moving and talking barely
reaches your ears.  The only light in this section of the city comes from
your light source.  You stands against the huge cavern's walls.  Water
glints in the light on the walls.

North east corner on Wrym and Sunrise~

muffled echoes bounce off the cavern walls and into your ear.  You can
hear the screams of the slave, the talking of adventurers.  The cavern walls
loom up to the east and north of you.  You light doesn't even illuminate up
to the ceiling.  Darkness surrounds you.  The ground is hard and grey.  The
walls are grey, and glint with wetness.  You wish you could recall to
Midgaard, but alas, that is impossible.

darkness that lives in this city.  Everywhere darkness creeps, even with the
lights that adorn some of the streets, it is still dark. To your east lies the
entrance to a dark building and it see to just disappear into the night.  The
door seems to be rusted shut.

just be the darkness that lies just beyond your insignificant circle of light.

reason you can even think up is the fact that sunset if on the west side of
the city.  Screams echo towards you from all sides assaulting your senses. 
You eyes hurt from trying to pierce the darkness that lies everywhere.  The
ground is rough through your boots.  The air is cool, and the cavern wall to
your west glints with wetness.

of struggle leaving tunnels all over this area, a mage cast a very powerful

The slaver's route, almost everyone in the Underdark has walked along
these famous stones.  It was along this road that the city was made. 
Without the slave trade, the city would not have expanded as fast as it did
when the city was first built.  The Underdark has since become a trade
centre where those who dwell beneath the ground and those above can
interact in relative safety.

You walk along the main trade route of the city, the slaver's route.  As you
walk, you listen to the buzz of creatures interacting with one another.  You
have hear blades clanging in a heated battle, the yells of the shop keepers
trying to sell their wares, the ultimate silence that only death can bring
about.

Slaver's Route at Emerald~
As you walk deeper into the city, you realise that this city is huge and
therefore confusing.  It's seems lawless, but then you see a floating eye
teleport a person to their jails.  You wonder what laws a city like this has,
then you see a person in a fight being taken away also.  Maybe there are
rules after all...

Slaver's Route before the Inn~
You stop for a second to look around.  You take in everything you can
about this weird and twisted underground city.  The sounds of thousands
fills your ears.  The smell of sweat and blood forces you to wheeze.  The
dim glow of the orbs makes you squint to see shapes that are beyond your
light source.  A dangerous city indeed, made even more so be the fact that
you CAN'T RECALL...

To the north is The Floating Eye (an inn).  Slaver's does east and west.

You stand on the slaver's route.  The road stretches on between two huge
buildings.  The building to the south is the head quarters for the guardian
eyes and to the north is the inn.  The road here is very clean and better lit
then most of the city.  The shadow's seem less ominous here.  A couple
orbs seem to have stopped functioning here. 
South is the entrance to the Guardian Eye's headquarters and the prisons.

You are walking along the slaver's route.  The slaver's route is a wide
street with plenty of room for flocks of slaves.  The street is well worn,
worn down by the feet of the enslaved and imprisoned.  To the west you
can hear a slave master shouting at his slaves.  Small glowing orbs light
the way for you.

bodies irritates your nose.  The sweet, tangy smell of sweat and blood causes 
your stomach to turn.
Squinting in the dim light, you think you see a huddled form lying off 
to the side of the road.

to have been beaten and whipped 'till the slave died. ~

Slaver's Route~
You stand on the slaver's route, so named for the simple reason that the
slaver's use this road to transport their merchandise.  The slaver's in the
Underdark are renowned for their cruelty, you can tell that this rumour is
true by all the screams of pain and horror that seem to come from all
around you.  The shadows of the city seem to live and breed by
themselves.  Above your head are small floating orbs that bathe the street
with a dim light.

To the east is the eastern entrance, to the west, the slaver's route.

Before the east entrance~
You stand just at the east entrance to the Underdark.  Before you looms a
huge cavern, or so you think, since you can't tell with your eyes.  Darkness
is everywhere, there is a layer of light that has been formed by a series of
floating orbs that rest above your head.  Above this layer of light, darkness
lies.  It is because of this that you think you stand in a huge cavern.  The
air smells of thousands living in a confined space with little fresh air.  The
air itself is moist and warm.  Sounds assault your ears, not just the buzzing
of people. but also agonized screams.  The shadows seems to speak of
death.  Welcome to the Underdark. 

The north and south is Sunrise, to the east is the entrance and to the west is
the Slaver's route and farther down, the market area.

The Gathering Place~
You are in the north west corner of the gathering place.  It is here that the
denizens of the Underdark come to meet to discuss business.  The lighting
here is dimmer than in most places.  Dark shapes seem to blend in and out
of the shadows.  Somehow the sounds of the city do not invade this place
so it is quiet enough to discuss without shouting.  The square is basically
clear but the dimness makes it impossible to see farther than 10 feet, thus
making it perfect for meetings of a discrete manner.  It seems as if some
orbs have stopped working.

your ears only your breathing and the blood gushing through your body. 
Everything seems to be distance, nothing looks real.  You feel isolated
from society as a whole, ignored, worthless.  There is nothing to live for,
people whisper in the shadows, plotting the downfall of the world. 
Nothing can stop it, there is no point.  How can you as an individual make
a difference?  For a moment, these words form in the air "Welcome to the
darkside" you feel empty and drained.  No life stirs within, a chill
threatens to overcome your entire being.

The Slave's Square~
You are in one of the most oppressed regions of the Underdark.  It is here
that the capitalist dream has become totally realised.  The oppression and
repression of those who should be free is evident in everything that stands
in this square.  Stocks to hold the bad slaves, a guillotine to kill the slaves
that stand up for their rights.  The slaves are reduced to animals in this
square.

execution.  The ground is clean, with dark brown spots here and there. 
The dark brown stains are stains of blood.

ground has dark brown stains on it.  The cruel reality of slavery can be felt
by your soul, causing is to ache to own and manipulate other beings.  You
can realise this desire to the west.

compared to midgaard.  The city that was founded has grown to fill the
cavern and thrives in the dark.  Over half the people who live here can see
in the dark, the floating orbs were placed for the surface dwellers so they
could kinda see.

enters your head, the shadows begin to come alive.  Always, just out of

now is about 2 times larger than Midgaard.  This is the meeting place of
the rogues and thieves from the world of sun and moon and those who
dwell beneath the earth.

huge guardian eyes float through the city preventing open fights.  Glowing
orbs float in the air, casting their dim glow on all around.  Illuminating
basically nothing but giving some light.

city like most of the city isn't very well lit.  A solitary glowing orb floats
casting a thin circle of light on the ground.  As with all sections of this
street, this part has been dedicated to a god, Silence.  As soon as you
realise this, you understand why this section of the city is so quiet. A statue
of a githzerai seems to be kneeling to a statue of Silence.

and very capable with mental powers.  This statue is very lifelike, and it's

This is a statue of the god of agility and speed.  He is dressed totally in a

there is a note that reads

    Silence is both provider and destroyer, to be blessed by him is to           
be blessed indeed.

You take one final look at this impressive almost life like representation of
Silence and notice that it's eyes glow purple and seem to be watching your

Street of the Gods, Reflection~
This segment of the Underdark has been dedicated to Reflection, the
goddess of beauty and love.  All around you the golden light of the orbs
illuminates objects of sheer beauty.  The beauty of Reflection comes out in
all the objects along this road.  You feel the need to stop and just let all
this beauty into your soul.

You have entered the section of the street of gods that has been obviously
dedicated to Dizzy.  The reason why this is obvious is the fact that you feel
very nauseous and confused.  You are having problems figuring out up and
down, left and right.  The ground seems to be rising up to your face.

Raptor is one of those all powerful immortals who has figured out the very
fabric of the worlds.  On the ground lie a bunch of arcane and mystic
symbols.

Street of the Gods, RoX~
This section of the street has been dedicated to RoX.  The street is clean
and well built, no bugs in it.  Orbs float every ten feet, although the street
is clean, the shadows are darker than they should be and whisper of
assassins.  The lighting cast from the orbs is not white, it's cobalt blue. 
The screams of the city do not penetrate into this section.  On the ground
lie holy symbols of Farside, RoX's playground.

East and west the street continues, north is the slave's square and south is

Street of the Gods, Soapbox~
This street has been built to honour the gods of the realms.  Since the
street was built, the Underdark has flourished.  You have heard rumours
that at certain sections on this street, you can actually recall.  The street
has been indeed blessed by the gods.  On the ground are a series of arcane
symbols.

Street of the Gods, Garion~
You are standing on the street of the gods.  Instead of building a temple,
the denizens of the Underdark built a road dedicated to them.   This
section of the road honours Garion and his true understanding of the fabric
of life.  Garion with his foresight to bring people together so they can
defend themselves from their enemies and unite for a common goal.

this name is very obvious.  All around you more shadows then there should
be form.  Everything seems to be cloaked in it's own shadow.  The light of
the orbs and from your light source does nothing to illuminate the area.

cast a huge spell along this road to give it this affect.  Whatever the reason
is, you can barely see anything around you.

north, the darkness clears up considerably.

North is the beginning of the street of Gods.  East and west the road of

anything that happens. All around you the darkness hovers, and hides
anything that may be dangerous.

The alley continues north and south.

entire cavern was filled with veins of gems and precious metals.  It was
first mined by the duergar who lost it to the drow.  Much later a mighty
wizard came to the area and created a huge cavern from the many tunnels. 
Where the mighty veins once were now only roads exist.

different precious stones.  Azurite has left it's mark on the street.  The

smooth by the dragging feet of the slave flocks. You stand just before the
Underdark.  The Underdark is a huge city that rivals it's surface counterpart,
Midgaard.  From what you have heard, anything goes in the Underdark.  A
dangerous place at best, only those who have had at least ten levels of
experience should venture into it.  On the wall to the north are a series of 
markings that you can't make out at this distance.

mage cast a mighty spell that cursed the entire city preventing people from
recalling out of it.  This makes it a perfect place to sell slaves and buy
slaves.  Although most think it as being lawless, there is a code and this
code is enforced by huge floating eyes.

The Gemstone~
You are standing in the midst of a crowded tavern, at the north east side. 
A bard sits on a stool playing his lute.  The lute is just a tad out of tune and
every now and then a cord causes you to cringe.  Laughter and shouting
surrounds you.  Tables stand where there is room, and over half of them
are occupied.  The table tops are covered with empty and half filled
tankards of ale.

of hard alcohol stings your nose.  The tavern itself is dark with little
lighting.  One the walls are small cases of different gemstones.

The Gemstone~
You are standing just before the entrance to the Gemstone.  In the dim
light you can make out the huddled forms of people are tables.  The air is
thick with smoke, and smells of alcohol.  The floor remarkably is clean
and so are the walls, the tables are another story.  It seems to be a friendly
enough place, well as friendly as you can get in the Underdark.

You are standing at the bar of the Gemstone.  The counter of the bar is
covered with glasses and bottles.  A still lit pipe sits on the counter off to
the side.  People seem to just be hanging around with nowhere to go.  The
floor is sticky here, you figure someone spilt their drink not long ago.  A
slumped form lies against the north wall.

escape from this open passage and drip onto his tunic. ~

Deserted Warehouse~
You are standing in the so called deserted warehouse and you are
beginning to wonder if it really is that deserted.  You keep hearing weird
noises from behind the walls and above your head.  It is dark in here and
there is no light.  Your circle of light illuminates debris on the ground and
walls that look as if they will fall over with even the slightest pressure.

walls that seem to spring out of nowhere.  You keep hearing a knocking
sound from the rafters and walls.  The walls are made of wood and seem to
have been erected by chance rather than by planning.
