Entrance to the mountains~
You come to the foothills of the Ito Mountains.  A forest surrounds you
as the path continues through the hills to the mountains looming beyond
Small animals scurry into the forest as you hurry along the path.  All is
silent as if some great presence lurks within.

presence in these mountains and a cold chill runs down your back.  Short
croaks can be heard and a pond is to your left.  Frogs leap in and out, but
grow quiet as you walk by.

front of you.

The forest thickens as you walk this path.  Many trees seem to block your
vision and forest sounds assault your ears.  The faint sound of a hammer on
metal can be heard in the distance.  Other than that, you neither see nor
hear any signs of intelligent life.

You can barely make out the path in front of you, even your light doesn't
penetrate the darkness because of the trees.  You smell woodsmoke wafting in
from the east, and voices can be heard, but you can barely make out the
words.  You sense many eyes watching you and an unfriendly presence is
nearby.

small breeze caresses your body and lifts your spirits, as you prepare for
the inevitable conflict to come.  Unless you leave now of course.

soldiers defending this outpost from a current attack.  The defending unit
seems to know what they are doing, and the defenders seem to be winning. 
Even though they aren't dressed in the fine plate that the attackers seem to
have, they are light and quick, and possess great skill at hand to hand
combat.  There is a door north to the outpost.

An abandoned house.~
This building is dark.  Real dark.  You can't even see your hand in front
of your face, and your light gives off a sickly glow.  Even the torchlight
coming through the open door seems paled as soon as it hits the doorway. 
You catch a glimpse of a magical aura as you turn to leave.

Farther into an attic.~
Cobwebs hang like ropes from the ceiling and a small chest sits here in
the dust.  Spiders dangle from draglines on the wall, and bugs glisten in
the light from your torch

Road to the Pagoda.~
You travel along a small roadnorth of the main street.  You see a large
pagoda to the north.  As you wonder what perils lie ahead for you, you are
distracted from your reverie by the sound of a large animal roaring.

The entrance to the Pagoda.~
You stand inside a large pagoda.  It has to be at least 40 feet high and
it's huge!  The rooms span out before you like a field of wheat and screams
come from the north east, as if someone is practicing beating someone to a
pulp.

The Pagoda.~
Darkness pervades this room, and you can't see much of anything here. 
More screams echo from the north and light comes from the northwest

Nearer to Enlightenment.~
You feel at peace with your inner self.  They say enlightenment comes to
those who wait.  But can you wait while someone is pouunding on your skull? 
You see someone appear from the shadows, and attack.  Guess you'll find out
soon enough huh?

Enlightnement comes at a cost.  A high cost indeed.  This old man has
payed his price, and now he will make you pay yours.

The Light of the Pagoda.~
The light here is calming, you notice a boy in the center of the pool of
light and he looks at you and frowns.  Shielding your eyes from the
brilliance, you notice him stand and look at you.  His frown deepens and he
reaches for his weapon...

The darkness of the Pagoda.~
This room is so dark you can't even see two inches in front of you. 
Darkness wages a war with light as you struggle to see your surroundings. 
You feel a presence in front of you, and notice part of the darkness
coalescing into an enemy that you can barely make out.  Maybe he can show
you the way to the light.  Or he'll just skewer you and be done with it.

You have come upon a small bend in the path.  The trees and darkness seem
to close around you and animals of the forest quiet themselves and take
flight at your approach.  Exits are east and west.

As you round the bend to continue upon thepath, you notice a forbidding
gate to the north.  From this distance it seems that you can barely make out
moving spots of torchlight.  Preparing yourself for a confrontaion that may
never happen, you press onward.
