Path Into the Valley~
Glinting as a diamond against a backdrop of black velvet, the Valley of
Kings lies below you.  The sun shines brightly upon your head, warming your
spirits as you gaze upon this wondrous place.  It is as the legends have
told.  The beauty of the swaying palm trees amidst the arid desert valley
stir your very soul.  It is a place of beauty and mystery that beckons for
all who see it to enter.

Path Into the Valley~
As you enter the valley the path turns to the east, then down yet again. 
The green of the forest fades as the desert takes over here.  It is still an
exotic beautiful place.  The heat begins to rise, the dry air makes you
thirst for something cool to drink.  Three pyramids are faintly visible
below you.  One is quite large, flanked by two smaller ones to the east and
west.  A feeling of expectation rises within you.  Perhaps the legends are
true.

you.  The sun continues its incessant beating upon the back of your head.  A
slight cooling breeze stirs here.  It is a most welcome surprise.

Finally!  The long trek into the valley is at an end.  A huge desert
valley stands before you.  The entrance to the north is flanked by two huge
sphinxes carved of stone.  The outline of the three great pyramids is
clearly visible from here.  This is a place of great mystery and beauty. 
Something pulls you in the direction of the center pyramid.  It is a force
hard to deny.

The sides of the valley rise steeply to the east and west.  It would be
impossible to escape up those steep stone walls.  The sun has risen high
into the cloudless azure sky, scorching all in its path with intense golden
rays of heat.  Then you see the guardians of the valley and gasp in awe! 
Everything you have heard is true, it must be the Valley of the Kings.

paths lead to the east and west, while the large path continues to the north
and back to the south.  From this part of the valley the three pyramids are
clearly visible.  In the clear light of day it is a sight to behold.  These
are indeed marvels of this realm.

The Great Pyramid~
A huge pyramid constructed entirely of gigantic stone blocks stands
before you.  It rises high above you, making you feel insignificant standing
beside it.  Two lesser pyramids, stand to the east and west of this larger
one.  Even the blazing of the midday sun and the relentless dry heat can not
take away from this moment of discovery.  The great burial chamber of the
king must lie within this pyramid.

Entrance to the Pyramid~
The entry way of the pyramid is an enormous arched doorway.  Each stone
was lovingly carved and placed to form the vaulted ceiling.  The wind howls
through this place, sighing and moaning as if it were a tortured soul. 
Legends have been told of this place and the riches that are hidden here. 
One can only hope the legends are true.  A dust devil swirls by you,
entering the passage to the east.  What riches could lie hidden there?

Stone Corridor~
This stone corridor is narrow and constructed entirely of stone.  An
occasional rat scurries by your feet.  It is deathly quiet here.  The only
obvious exit lies to the south.  There is nothing special here.

False Tomb~
The walls of this large room extend high above your head.  The air is hot
and dank with the smell of a long closed in space.  A low whistling howl of
the wind raises the hairs on the back of your neck.  There is a feeling of
not being alone in this room.  The dust is thick, stirring with every step
you take.  A small ray of light nearly blinds you as it falls through a
small ventilation shaft in one wall.  Rats scurry about the chamber.  One
brushes by your ankle startling you.  It is then you see what else is in
this room with you.  How long he has been here is a mystery.

False Tomb~
The walls and floor of this false tomb are made completely of huge blocks
of stone.  Each one must weigh tons!  How could anyone lift these mammoth
blocks of stone?  The air is dank with the smell of decay and mold.  It is
untelling how long this place has been without a breath of fresh air.  Dust
puffs into the air from the floor as you walk about the room.  There is the
faint imprint of other footsteps in the dust there.  It is only when you
approach the most distant corner of the room that you see the horror that
lies in this place.  Scream!  Run, while you still can.  Pray they do not
catch you with their bony hands!!

Wide Stone Corridor~
It is dark here, with just a faint hint of the light of day coming into
this place from the entryway.  The darkness does not reduce your excitement
at finding this place.  Each step you take echoes hollowly within this great
stone hallway.  The walls are decorated with hieroglyphs detailing the
journey of the king into the afterlife.  Paintings are in place there as
well, foretelling of this mythical process.

Large Stone Chamber~
Torches hang about the walls of this spacious chamber, fluttering weakly
in some mysterious breeze.  Servants have gathered here, weeping and wailing
their grief at the passing of a great king.  Each one has chosen to follow
their king into the afterlife, and so have come here to be prepared.  It is
a great honor to be allowed to do so, a place in history is saved for each
one who does so.

some strange mantra, casting mystical powders into the fire.  Sparks leap,
swirling into the highest depths of the room.  Colored smoke hazes a clear
view of what lies further ahead.  Murals depicting the gods awaiting the
king in the afterlife have been etched on these walls.  It is indeed a sight
to behold.

quite plain here, there are no hieroglyphs or murals.  A chemical smell
hangs heavy in the air, as well as the sweet fragrance of honey and other
rich herbs and spices.  Large earthen jars sit about the room, each one
decorated with intricate symbols.  This is the chamber for preparation,
where the king is made ready to travel to the afterlife.

Precious gold has been used to detail some of the gods of higher power.  The
goddess of fertility is placed in the very center of one mural.  Women are
highly prized, as are the children they bear.  Oh how these people love and

At last!  The burial chamber is here, the final room it would appear of

raised dais.  It is quite large, decorated most lavishly with jewels and
gold encrusting.  What could lie inside this wondrous tomb?  Could the mummy
of the king lie here?  Or does hidden treasure await you?

What a horrible sight awaits you!  This place is lit with smoldering
torches that hang from brackets on the walls.  There is a haze of smoke
obscuring a clear view of this place.  Blood and gore are splattered
everywhere.  The stench of death is almost unbearable.  A half eaten corpse
lies against one wall, a bloody sword still clutched in one skeletal hand. 
Death must live here and he flourishes in this place of horror.

Sandy Path~
The wind is quite harsh here, as is the sun on your head.  The azure blue

path in great rippling waves, making it difficult to walk through this area.
A walking stick sure would come in handy.  Somewhere nearby you can almost
swear you hear the sounds of life.  Perhaps a village is nearby.  It would
be nice to rest in the shade and partake of a cup of wine.

of granite, shouting orders in an unknown tongue.  It amazes you that so few
men can move such huge slabs of rock in the way that they do.  Yet again you

area is well kept, not a bit of trash lies about.  The villagers take pride
in this place, keeping it looking neat and orderly at all times.  As the sun
shifts in the sky, seeking the horizon, the shadow of the great pyramid
falls over you.  A feeling of cold dread takes hold for some unknown reason.

Footprints of varying sizes and kinds mark the sand.  At least you are not the only one who has been here.

of the chamber.  Light shines through a large gaping hole in the ceiling.  
Hmm...where could this go?

Stairway~
Narrow and unstable.  Those are the two words that spring to mind as soon
as you begin to travers this stairway.  It seems the architects who designed
the Greater Pyramid did not do their jobs so well in this place.

Room of Safe Haven~
What a pleasant surpise awaits you here!  A sofa is pushed against one
wall.  The fragrant aroma of healing herbs fills the air.  This is a safe
room where you may rest and restore yourself.  Just from what you have seen
of this pyramid nothing that could lie ahead of you will be pleasant.

Spiral Chamber~
The floor seems to slowly rise upward.  The change is not very
noticeable, but a feeling that you are climbing higher possesses you.  It is
terribly quiet and still here.  The stillness is more frightening than the
sounds of any apparition you could hear.  It seems the walls are slowly
closing in on you.  Hurry!  Get out while you still can!

The Pinnacle~
The back side of the pyramid has not yet been finished in this area. 
From this point the view of the valley is breathtaking!  The king must
reside here, but where?  The search thus far has been fruitless and very
frustrating.  Bah!  A strong person does not give up so easily, nor do you. 
Continue and find what awaits you...  If you dare.

Narrow Walkway~
A narrow walkway made of a single rough hewn board, perhaps wide enough
for two feet to rest on, is all that leads to the chamber that beckons just
beyond you.  Watch it!  The walkway is so narrow your foot slipped.  The
drop from here would be enough to kill someone instantly.  Proceed carefully
for the prize is not far from falling into your grasp.

Mystical Chamber~
Shimmering in the light that comes from your torch, the stones that make
up this room gleam as if made of gold.  A strange humming seems reverbrate
through this room.  Slowly it seems to be taking possession of your very
soul.  Scream!  Cry out and flee if you still can.  The arcane powers of the
pyramid have been unleashed upon you it seems.

Sandy Path~
The path is covered in sand, it takes hold of everything in this valley
it seems.  Still the sun beats relentlessly down on your head.  The heat is
almost unbearable, the yearning for a cool drink of water has returned. 
Just ahead to the north the pyramid stands framed against the desert valley.

Before the Lesser Pyramid~
The pyramid is not as large as the Great Pyramid.  It is still impressive
in size and architecture.  Each block of stone has been painstakingly laid. 
It appears however that the uppermost portion of the pyramid is still under
construction.  The sound of workers yelling and singing can be heard clearly
throughout this area.

Entrance to the Pyramid~
Looming above you, the entrance ceiling is vaulted and seems to almost
reach the clouds.  The darkness is heavy ahead, with nothing to shed light. 
Hold on to your torch and make an effort to go forward, not back.  Perhaps
the exploration would be worth it, that is the question you keep repeating
over and over in your mind.  What could be so horrible here that a strong,
brave warrior of any kind could not venture here?  Into the pyramid, down
will take you back to the path and safety.  
Exits lead to the north into the pyramid, down leads back to the path.

Narrow Corridor~
The corridor is quite narrow, seeming to close in as you pass through. 
Sand has blown in from the entrance and covers the floor.  It crunches under
your feet as you walk through the hallway.  The wind howls through the
pyramid.  Quite a haunting sound in a place of such unease.

Chamber of the Queen Mother~
Embroidered satin pillows are neatly arranged in a corner of this
chamber.  A brass candelabra sits on a low table, casting a warm golden
light into the room.  Exotic flowers are arranged in a vase.  The fragrance
fills the room.  Then you see it!  A throne to outshine all other thrones
that you have seen before.  It is gold and encrusted with jewels of all
kinds.

Chamber of Mourning~
This smaller chamber is no less lavishly appointed than any royal
chamber.  Lush chairs and sofas sit about.  A crystal chandelier hangs from
the center of the ceiling.  The things that have been placed here are indeed
fit for the royal family.  Several servants stand about waiting to serve the
family in waiting.

what could be stored inside these crates?  Is it worth possibly being caught
here to find out.

Dark Chamber~
It is quite dark here.  The feeble light you hold can barely penetrate
the gloom.  Strange scurrying noises come from the far distant corners of
the room.  For some reason it strikes you that those sounds could not come
from just a small animal.  Something quite large must live in this room.  As
you turn to go it strikes you from behind.  The great zombie of the pyramid
has come to claim his next victim.
