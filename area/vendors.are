A T in the trail~
Huge bushes with sharp edges lie about to the north disabling any
further passage to the north.  The way northward inclines up as
huge greeneries outline the bushes making it impossible to move
around you.  A small campsite of sorts is seen before you as several
logs used for resting lie here and there.  The path headed south
descends slightly as the hills loom high around you.  Two trails
leading east and west make this straight path accessible leading
into the unknown.  Distant hills are faintly foreseeable to the
east while rising mountains to the west.

Climbing the hills~
A visible dirt path moves north and south here as movement slightly
slants upward to the north while the road straightens out to the
south.  The hills to the north start mounding closer as you eye
towards that direction.  The path southward begins to open as you
notice something in the distance.

A slight ascent northward~
The road passes through the north and south here where the air
is still and all is quiet.  Chirps of wildlife scream in the distance
somewhere while the fields around you are open.  Hills appear from
the distant north while activity is heard and seen to the south.

A quiet trail~
The road leading north and south from here is very wide and is
strangely quiet.  Stories of strange things have been told around
these areas mystifing commoners, thus, making this road a more
lessened path to travel.  Nothing special is seen but the distant
mountains to the west and the sea of trees to the far east.

A quiet north-south trail~
The wide road crosses to the north and south here as you notice
open gates leading into some strange deserted village of sorts.
A slight chill flows about you as you notice not much traffic passing
by here.

Outside the southern gates of a north-south trail~
Your mind is in wonder as you notice two huge brown posts standing
beside the road here with two huge black gates swung open allowing
travellers to roam in and out here.  As you look inside the gates,
you find that there are no city walls looming along the sides but
just a path headed northward where several objects of sorts can
be seen.  A path to the south travels out into the peaceful open.

Inside the northern gates of a north-southern trail~
Two gigantic brown posts stand high beside the road here as two aging
black gates are open for those to pass by.  You wonder why gates are posted
here as the open space around you are not barricaded like a village or town
should be.  As you peek around the area, you notice not much to be seen but
a dirt path that resumes to the south and north of you where the trail is
wide.

A trail north and south~
The dirt trail stays wide as it leads itself north and south here.  The
flow of traffic seems to be scarce yet the weather seems to be peaceful and
quiet..  Or is it too quiet?  A SIGN is posted beside the trail here.

A trail north and south~
The trail here moves about to the north and south.  The open fields
bring about an openess to this way..  But strangely a much quieter
place.  To the west lies a small boarded-up shed where noises of
some sort of shrieking and roaring can be heard.  A small SIGN
is posted beside the road here.

A trail north and south~
The smell of some aromatic delights fill the air around you.  You stand
here momentarily to savor the delicious scents of mouth-watering food that
swarm the area.  All you can see is the open fields around and the
continuous trail that goes north and south here.  A SIGN is posted here.

A trail north and south~
A strange unknown smell can be seen as a stench of smoke looms about
here.  The path to the north widens out into the open where the southern
path begins to gently thin out to its normal length.  A SIGN is posted

distant north widen out providing a beautiful landscape from a distance.  A
trail to the south leads itself descending from afar.  A SIGN is posted

A continuous straight path inside the southern gates~
Two huge brown posts stand high beside the road here as two aging
black gates are open for those passing through.  You stand in wonder
why gates are posted here as the open hills around you are not
barricaded like a village or castle should.  As you scan about,
you notice the hills descend to the south while a trail heads off
to the north.

Amongst huge gates~
You stand before the two huge brown posts standing aside the road with
two huge black gates swing open inward to the north.  Strange how no city
walls furnish across to your west or east in providing inside shelter into
this path that heads north and south.

A straightened trail~
The path here makes a descent in the southerly direction where it is
strangely quiet.  Not much signs of life can be detected in that way.  To
the north lies some huge posts standing beside the road.  Beside the road
here a flurry of dry grass and yellow meadows illuminate around you.

On a north-south path~
The path descends in a much more slant as the hills to the north
begin to rise high above you.  Determining which way you're headed,
the path moves in a diagonal trajectory.  Several trees lie visible
at the west while a distant row of hills is at the far east in
a distance.  The ground here begins to harden a bit the more you
head southward.

Along the north-south trail~
The trail continues on north and south from here.  The ground here is
rough as the flatlands visibly crackle from the ongoing drought that has
plagued this area recently.  A huge hill approaches to the north where
nothing but the whispers of the faint wind emits its mysteriousness here.

Ascending west~
The trail this way slowly ascends as mountains to the northwest
began looming into view.  A climb heightens further to the west
while the ground remains level off to the east.  Lands afar into
the open wide is seen to the south where the scarcity of any signs
of life can be seen.

A westward climb~
The trail westwards ascends further inclining a diagonal way making
walking on foot a labor.  The trail eastward descends a bit towards
open land.  The astounding sights of the high mountains stand high
to the north and to the northwest.  A more visible and foreseeable
mountain stands closer to the west where elevation begins to rise
rapidly.

A climb to the western mountains~
The mountain to the west stands with smaller hilly trails fabricated
with sharp rocks and boulders.  It seems as if a recent rockslide
has overwhelmed the whole way around the huge mountain westward.
A further open unwalkable trail to a distant mountain is to the
north.  High caps of snow overlay the summit of the mountains as
several clouds hang high above.  The trail to the west makes a
sharp 45 degree angle climb to where a level trail is visible just
above it.  A path away from this mountainous area falls a bit to
the east.

below to the east begins to seem steeper from here.  Faint open fields are
seen to the southeast while more mountains become visible to the north.

Westward in the mountains~
The ground momentarily levels off here as the sharp decline to
the ledge takes you down to the valley below.  The trail slowly
ascends once more here as the bottom most part of the mountains
to the west just lie within a matter of feet before you.  The air
seemingly has decreased in breathing as the oxygen is thin here.

Outside a cave~
A small circular cave makes passage inside the high rocky mountains
to the west.  The awe-stricken spectacle of ageless rock monumentally
stands across the whole northwestern to the southwestern plains
of the mountains here.  A very small echoish noise reveals inside
the cave.  To the east, the path descends a bit to the level grounds
seen distantly far below.

Inside the cave~
All is dark inside this cave!  Only hollow sounds of the winds flowing
from east and west here are heard while much about inside shows nothing of
importance.  Several bones from an animal lie perch in the corner while the
beam from both the east and west give off some signs of light in here.

On the other side of the mountains~
The mountainous hills above the cave here hang over from where
you stand as a shaded sky brings about the scenery around you.
Masses of stones and rocks are about everywhere as much debris
lay here and there---some from the path you're travelling on. 
You find yourself on the other side of the mountains into a new
realm where a small trail to the west slowly descends then turning
to the northwest where more rocks can be seen.  The cold breeze
inside the cave allows direction that way away from here.

A path along the northern mountain~
A trail made of dirt flows along here east and west.  A rising mountain
ascends high as it moves to the east where deep to the northeast a hollow
valley can be seen.  A choice of directions can be seen distantly to the
west.  The way through here is entrenched with rough terrains while the air
itself is rather mild.

A turn into the northern mountain~
The trail here takes a sharp turn north while to the east a large
circular patch of green grass grows.  The odd thing of this path
is that this grass is set here with no real significance or has
of any special reason as to why the way turns north.  A hollow
valley between two huge mountains is seen northwards while the
open wide is seen across to the south where flatter lands and more
greeneries are seen.

At the base of a hilly mountain~
High monumental aged stones and rocks outlay the mountain to the
north.  The path takes a turn eastward to where air is seemingly
scarce.  A slant in the walk makes travel a bit slow as a huge
layer of greenery lies to the south.  A few trees stand amongst
the rocks as the evergreens seem to remain showing no signs of
age whatsoever.

Before a new opening in the mountain~
The directions possible head west, north and south here.  A huge gap
between the Northern mountains can be seen ahead to the north where the
trail makes a sudden rise upward upon a small mountain that portrays a walk
that hovers above and beyond the other side.  A descent to the south makes
the journey more easier and steadys a more foot pleasing walk down that
way.

A turn in the mountainous descent~
A path here curves sharply to the east where the mountainous structures
to the northwest make a steady decline in its size as the path
carries east.  Towards that direction, a faint smoky patch makes
a brief puff to the sky as possible signs of life can be seen that
way.  Distant lands carry far south of here to where many of what
occurs beyond is all that can be seen that way.

A slanted trail descending east~
An east-west path carries itself along here.  Several shrubs are
scattered about here as the dirt is rough and the way to the east
seems to dip over and under slightly like humps of hills seem present
in view.  The enormous mountains that stand distant northwest stretches
away from this path going northeast as this trail begins to slightly
curve away from it.  A small valley to the north reveals a strange
clearing where the mountain widens despite the high summits all
around.

A path going east.~
The trail makes a hump as the path hovers down and up east-west
of here.  A steady but slight ascent makes way to the west while
a strange garden is set this way to the east.  Faint voices
of life and activity are briefly heard as small bushy barriers
perch along the east stretching both the northwest and southeast
as boundaries from this strange sight seen to to the east.

Amongst the northern mountain~
A cold blowing wind rushes through here as the wind chill has made this
passageway not to be encamped in.  A darker shade of light is seen as the
high mountains east and west only allow any sense of life to be seen to the
north and the south.  It seems once you reach beyond these mountains, much
seen afterwards could reveal many things never experienced by the weary
traveller!

where you stand while to the northeast lurks high mountainous rocks and
eerie clouds lurking from that area.

as the open plains begin to widen with the distant mountains before
it visibly.  The only travels moveable go north and south here.

A slight ascent north~
The walk here begins to reveal itself more as the path heads north. 
Faint lands from the south linger from afar.  Several small shrubs of grass
grow amongst the sides here as outlines of mountains lie far to the
northwest as several stone-like caverns stand at the farthest northeast.

Climbing passage northwards~
Branches protrude through the way as the open space of the lands
seen beyond give a wide range view of the path ahead.  A small
descent into the greeneries below lies to the south.  The sound
is rather quiet as you momentarily examine the distance from around.
the mountains on the southwest give way to the open plains that
way.
