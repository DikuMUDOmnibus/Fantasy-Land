a rabid hyena~
A fierce dog cackles mercilessly in anticipation of your {!violent{x death.
~
This hyena is extremely fierce and relentless.  It is rumored that this
type of breed seeks out it's kills and merciless laughs as his prey dies
in slow agony.  Hopefully, you can manage to avoid or win over such a
creature as this.....but avoiding it's master is another story.  Perhaps,
you can persuade it's master, to make him find you favorable.

sign big delirium~
When the tower had been created..there was much comfort in the land             
  of the righteous and good.  An Avatar had been seated and a sense of
  security had prevailed over the land.  This security turned out to be
  false.  For in their solitude, a spawn had grown within...and as it
  grew, so did it's power.  The tower was easy prey for these demons of
  evil...and during the ensuing war, the tower had been magically duplicated
  and transformed in order to house the evil minions.  Then the townfolk
  had realized that this place was not the tower they had been seeking..
  By then, they were held captive...and their Avatar had disappeared
  mysteriously.....

 "For to yield to the power of evil is to swim deep in the rivers of            
  blood, sacred is death, and unholiness shall reign supreme in the
         agonized screams of triumph over your opressors."

A Room Engulfed in Darkness~
The room here is pitch black.  You can barely see your hand before your
face,  you try to reach around for a way out and find your hand touching
something or someone that remains unseen.  Perhaps you should leave while
your still breathing.

A Room of Portals~
You are in a room designed to provide transportation to the the other
levels above and below you.  It seems even the most ardent fanaticists
grow tired of travelling from floor to floor endlessly.
  A sign has been posted that provides the following information:

     Floor 5: North      Floor 6: South      Floor 7: East    
     Floor 4: West       Floor 2: Up           Floor 1: Down

below to the 50ft drop that awaits you should the flimsy support railings

A Room of Portals~
You have entered a portal testing room.  It is here that the mages practice
their portalling skills and create exits to aid them in their travels to
distant, and not so distant lands.

A Shimmering Passage of Light~
You are overwhelmed by the constant array of {#light{x bombarding your eyes

by without being seen, just as you are unable to see anything.

Chamber of the 2nd Draconian ArchMage~
This is the chamber of the avatar of the Draconian ArchMage beaten

An Escape From the Wind~
Alas, you have found a soothing spot free of wind and {4rain{x.  The enclosure
here is a warm welcome away from the constant weather changes outside.  
It seems you are not alone here after all, judging from the numerous footprints
and water puddles that can be seen covering the floor here.

The Final Battle~
The room appears as if a great battle had just occurred within these walls.
The stench of blood is both overwhelming and nauseating.  For here, is where
the final battle had occurred between the powerful Draconian Avatars.  For   
here is where one legend dies out while spawning the greater legend for all
to behold and worship.

corpse~
The battle was fierce and competitive, but in the end, Artema could not
gather up enough strength or power to defeat the mightiest of adversaries.
The echoes of Artema's deathcry shall forever echo hauntingly throughout
these tower walls, only to be drowned out by the dark and billowing laughter
of his murderer and current Avatar of Death, Destruction and Chaos....

A Mystical Waterfall of IceWine bubbles from the ground here and spills over

you're over the 5th layer of clouds and all you see is white.  Far below is a
ledge... Dare you risk the jump?

Vestigal of Frenzied Delirium~
You are immersed into a misty cloud of burnt ashes and smoldering
brimstone.  The vapors are enough to make the idea of clawing your
eyes out in defense from the seering heat seem pleasurable.  Each wall
shimmers omenously and hypnotic.  The floor seems to ebb and flow as if
it were built upon heated waters.  The ceiling appears to be suspended
above you as if at any moment it will crash down thunderously upon you.
  Perhaps it would be better, if not safer, for you to explore elsewhere.
That is, unless you truly wish to confront the resident of this heinous
place eye to eye.
