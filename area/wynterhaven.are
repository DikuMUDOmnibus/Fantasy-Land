The lines of wisdom are upon the story teller's face.  She has seen much,
and heard many things in her travels through this realm.  The horrors of
death, and the beauty of life linger in her mind.  She is as ancient as

simple robes enfold her thin body.  One hand reaches out to touch your face
with amazing gentleness.  An aura of peace seems to surround her.

From sea to snow~
A fresh blanket of snow covers the landscape.  Trees are outlined
in white.  The path is almost virginally pure, untouched by anything.
Still peaceful snowflakes fall gently from the sky.  The icy kisses
touch things almost lovingly.  Only a faint hint of the sun peaks
through the covering of clouds.  The path leads to the north through
the forest.  To the south the snow instantly turns to water as
the sea suddenly opens in that direction.

fox tears it to pieces is almost sickening.  Crimson spots of blood mar the
virginal white of the snow.

Weapons of every type and kind line the walls of the temple.  Each has
been honed to a razor sharpness.  Scrolls and tomes containing ancient words
of magic sit on a low table in one corner.  The warrior is rumored to be

Blacksmith's Shop~
The interior of the smithy is filled with a haze of smoke.  A heavily
muscled man stands near a huge anvil pounding a piece of iron into the shape
of a broadsword.  Weapons hang from brackets on the walls of the smithy. 
The weapons from this very shop have slain some of the most famous warriors
this realm has ever known.

Before the Crypt~
"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!
Whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
Desolate, yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted--
On this home by horror haunted--tell me truly, I implore:
Is there--is there balm in Gilead?--tell me--tell me I implore!"
Quoth the raven, "Nevermore."

Forest of Bulgaros~
The darkness is overwhelming.  It lingers over the forest much as the
plague does over the tiny village of Bulgaros.  It is rumored the vampires
brought the plague to this place when they settled here.  The path winds
through the forest, leading to the north.  A sliver of silver moon peeps
through the darkness clouds.  In the distance, a wolf howls.

Forest of Bulgaros~
The path narrows slightly.  Heavy brush and undergrowth surrounds the
path on all sides.  A fluttering bat dips down from the sky.  Again, the
lonesome howl of the wolf comes from not so far away.

A Clearing~
A clear brook runs through the center of the clearing.  Frogs croak and
sing in the moonlight.  The sense of fear that overwhelms the other parts of
the forest seem to have disappeared from this place.

In the Clearing~
A dark mansion stands in the clearing.  The windows are covered with
heavy iron bars.  The massive oak doors are closed.  It appears the place is
deserted.  The only sign of life are the villagers who scream as they search
the forest for vampires.

Hallway~
The hallway is dark and deserted.  A rat scurries across the floor just
to the north.  For a moment the sound of haunting violin music can be heard
to the north.  It is gone just as quickly as it came.

The walls of the west wing have collapsed inward.  The villagers had set
