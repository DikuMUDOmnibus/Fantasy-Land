The Path to the Castle~
The forest starts to thin out and the path becomes more travelled and
occupied.  The castle is in the not-too-far-distance.  Peddlers line the
streets before the gates to catch people as they enter the castle in a
last-ditch effort to hawk their wares...  It's also said the guards are less
dilligent in searching for sale permits outside of the castle walls.
