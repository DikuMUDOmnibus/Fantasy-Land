The Chambers of King Xara Udlar~
The chambers of the king are covered in a wallpaper of pure gold.  Silken
curtains are drawn to keep the light out, as the sun tends to shine brightly
from this high up.  Onyx columns offset the room and support the walls.  The
chambers are very well kept, a king sleeps here, they should be.
