King Bollo is a powerful magician with that talent of transformation of
others within a six foot range.  He is a distinguished older man with a long
history.  He had attempted to take over Yrarl by force many years ago, and
failing, was exiled to Wnde.  In another attempt to take over Yrarl he
discovered Castle Yrarl along with Ninald and Mmilta.  He later gave up
his attempted to rule Yrarl through force and bloodshed, and was surprised
to find himself given the throne when the old king died.  King Bollo is a
fair and honest man who decides issues without bias with a strong and firm
hand.  He has spent years grooming Alldeno for the throne, and hopes that one
day, Alldeno will make a just and able king.

from, along with his queen, Queen Elenda.  The castle is a large building
of stone, constructed by the slaves for King Yrarl eons ago.

You are standing before the large doors that lead into the Castle
Yrarl.  The castle looks forebodingly huge from here, almost more a
fortress than a castle, although the current King has made steps towards
renovating it so that it appears more friendly.  The massive stone blocks
that make up this castle look impossibly heavy and solid and you can only
marvel at the engineering of labor that constructing this castle must have
taken.  Hanging vines soften the harsh castle walls, and if one arrives
early enough, they are able to see the beautiful morning glories that bloom.

artistic eye than with a lavish eye.  There are no overt displays of wealth
here, yet the castle is furnished with tasteful and practical items.  The
elegant aqua carpeting offsets the stunning dark blue silk curtains that drape
about the windows.  A few torches peek out from bronze planters,
illuminating the room.
