Defiance Clan Recall~
You stand amongst the dead, a room littered in corpses.  The smell
is sickening , a red mist is in the air and as the taste of blood
hits your lips you realise that you were victorious in the struggle.
Our flesh will not bleed, but we drink the blood of others.  We
must defy, we must survive.
