0 'ADVERTISING'~
ADVERTISING~
Advertising of any mud on a public channel, a channel more than you
and whoever you are talking to can see, is strictly prohibited.
 
This not only means you cannot post mud names and addresses, but
this also means we do not need to hear about other muds, how this,
how that, how whatever. That is what instant messengers are for.
~

0 'AFFECTS' 'AFFECT'~
AFFECTS~
This command is used to show all the spells affecting your character.
At low levels, only the spell name will be displayed, at higher levels
the effects and duration of the spell will also be shown.  Spell effects
are no longer shown on score (this can be changed by using 'show'
command).
~

0 'AFK'~
AFK~
Typing AFK puts your character in a tell-saving mode as follows: any
tell to you is stored in a special buffer, and can be seen later by
typing replay. This is useful when you need to leave the mud for 5
or 10 minutes, but don't want to miss tells.  AFK shows up in your 
prompt until it is turned off.

also be seen by typing replay (unless, of course, the character logs
off before reading them).

0 'ALIAS' 'UNALIAS'~
ALIAS~
Syntax:
    alias <word>
    alias <word> <substitution>
    unalias <word>
{x
The alias command allows limited shortening of command names.  Alias
by itself lists your current aliases.  Alias <word> lists the alias with
that name (if such exists).  Alias with a word and argument will produce
a new alias.  The substitution is one or more commands separated by a
semicolon (;) symbol, and may contain a number of substitution commands,
which are: $1..  $9 and $*.  $1 stands for the first argument when first
argument when you use the alias, $2 for the second, etc.  $* stands for
the whole argument string that is following your alias.
{x
Examples:
> alias greet bow;tip $1;say Hello $1
> greet healer
You bow deeply.
You shake his hand.
You say '{SHello healer{x'
{x
> alias z ooc {{RStupid Title:{{n $*
> z hi
You [{nOOC{x] '{RStupid Title:{n hi{x'
{x
> alias test cast $1 $2;cast 'fire breath' $2;flee

Your blast of flame misses The fido! <0>
(skipped)
You flee from combat!
~

0 'ALIGN' 'ALIGNMENT'~
ALIGNMENT~
Alignment is an expression of your attitudes on life and how you react 
to situations.There's good, neutral, and evil alignments.  Your align-
ment is affected by the alignment of the foes you kill; kill an evil 
monster and your alignment shifts towards good, kill a good one, and
you head towards the dark side of things.
 
Alignment is expressed in numbers from 1000 (pure good) to -1000 (pure
evil), with 0 being true neutral. Most creatures are neither wholly
evil nor wholly good and have alignment scores between 500 and -500. 
You can check your alignment by typing SCORE. Spells such as DETECT
GOOD, DETECT EVIL, and KNOW ALIGNMENT will show you the alignment
of mobs and other players.
 
Alignment affects what equipment you may wear, weapons you may use, how
creatures react to you, experience gained, and, sometimes, what exits
you see.  The Temple of Alton houses recall for good and high-neutral
aligned characters.  The Temple of Shryp is home to those of evil and
low-neutral alignment.  Equipment that is not suited to your alignment
will be "zapped" off of you when you try to wear it. If you are of good
alignment, on occasion, Alton will protect you from harm in battle
(usually from teleport spells), but Shryp, being evil, leaves his
followers to fend for themselves.
 
 
If you wish to change your alignment in some way other than fighting
oppositely-aligned foes, you will pay dearly.  Go to the church in
town near Clan Road and either REPENT ALIGN or CURSE ALIGN at the
appropriate priest for the alignment you wish to become.

109 'ALLOW' 'BAN' 'PERMBAN'~
BANS~
Syntax: allow   <site>
	ban     <site> <newbies|all|permit>

the ban list, if the remover is of equal or higher level than the banner.

A site may have all players, new players, or non-permitted players (set
by editing the player file) banned, by changing the argument after the
site.  *s may be used to ban either by suffix (*.edu), prefix (labmac*),
or content (*andrews*), but be careful not to accidentallyntly lock out too
many sites with a wildcard.  Bans do not save unless the permban command
is used.

0 'AMBUSH'~
AMBUSH~
Syntax: Ambush <target>

0 'APPRENTICE'~
APPRENTICE~
Apprentices specialize in the casting of spells, offensive ones in
particular. Apprentices have the highest-powered magic of any other
class of it's level, and the only one able to use draconian and
enchanting spell groups. They are also very skilled at the use of
magical items, though their combat skills are the weakest of any class.

Apprentices make great allies to bands of fighters. With the fighters
doing the up close hand to hand combat, Apprentices can help obliterate
enemies via casting their range of offensive spells to help make the
enemy less effective in combat, thus making them more likely to die.
 
See also: CHECKSTATS CLASS APPRENTICE for a list of skills and spells.

23 strength from other factors (spells or items).

TIME shows the game time, as well as the time the mud was last started,
and the current local time for the host computer.

The attack spells are essentially powerful curses, fueled by divine
energy rather than magical power (like the combat spells are). They

a magical scroll; the <target> is optional, depending on the nature of
the scroll.  ZAP zaps a magical wand at a target.  If the target is not

a single charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a
magical object has no more charges, it will be consumed.

0 'BUILDERS'~
Builders~
As a builder, you start at 102. All the commands you need to build are 
there, do not ask for promotions, none are needed at this point. They
will come with time. So with that covered, lets go over the purpose.
 
Purpose: Using creativity and imagination, devise layouts, mobile{w
{x         {wnames, object names, and all around area themes.
 
Concern: This is a pk mud so focus on things that enhance pk.  Don't
{w         go overboard on the descriptions in the rooms, as most will
{w         probably be using brief, as its less spam for pking. However,
{w         if you want to, it's up to you. Do not worry about adding
{w         stats to objects or mobiles. We have some balancers that are
{w         in, but are being modified to be more efficient and more 
{w         options so we can complete these things in a timely manner.
 
SeekAid: If you find yourself stuck, use {Rindex olc{w, there'll be a list
{w         of files in which might help you out. Again don't worry about
{w         stats or scales, all subject to change. Or if Alton is on
{w         send him a tell and he will help you. (See {RHELP OLC_ABC{R){w
 
Morting: At this time, if you feel the desire, you may want to play
         a mortal to get a feel for the mud, might spur up some ideas.
{w         However, do not overlook the purpose of building. Once we get
         sufficient amount of areas built, we may open to the public 
         providing them with almost any option for equipment possible.
 
As always, enjoy the game and have fun. Any problems or concerns, feel
free to note Alton, or speak with Alton and they will be addressed. If
you have any ideas, in which you wanted to see on other muds and they 
couldn't code them, feel free to post them, I'm sure we can work
something out to make it fit into our vision. Once again enjoy your
stay and may we together bring this place to life.
 
Note: All Immortals who supply decent amt of areas, and time shall be
      permitted an imm position once we open, to further carry out 
      the needs of the mud.
 
~

0 'BUY' 'LIST' 'SELL' 'VALUE'~
STORES~
Syntax: buy   <object>
Syntax: list
Syntax: sell  <object>
Syntax: value <object>

BUY buys an object from a shop keeper. When multiple items of the same
name are listed, type 'buy n.item', where n is the position of the
item in a list of that name.  So if there are two swords, buy 
2.sword will buy the second. If you want to buy multiples of an item, 
use n*item where n is the quantity. (For example, 5*pie will buy 5 pies).
These can be combined into buy 2*2.shield, as long as the * is first.

LIST lists the objects the shop keeper will sell you.
List <name> shows you only objects of that name.

SELL sells an object to a shop keeper.

VALUE asks the shop keeper how much he, she, or it will buy the item
for.
~

0 'CALL LIGHTNING'~
CALL LIGHTNING~
Syntax: cast 'call lightning'

This spell works only out of doors and when the weather is bad.
It calls down lightning bolts from your god to strike your foes.
~

0 'CALM'~
CALM~
Syntax: cast 'calm' 

One of the most useful and often overlooked abilities of the master
cleric is the calm spell, which can put an end to all violence in a
room.  Calmed creatures will not attack of their own volition, and
are at a disadvantage in combat as long as the spell soothes their
minds.  The more violence activity there is in a room, the harder the
spell, and it is all or nothing -- either all combat in the room is
ended (with the exception of those who are immune to magic) or none is.
~

0 'CAMOFLAUGE'~
CAMOFLAUGE~
This skill allows forest dwellers to hide amongst trees and shrubs.
Moving targets are less likely to remain concealed.
~

0 'CAST'~
CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you
practice, the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting
spells costs mana. The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell
name. Example: cast 'cure crit' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-
word spells. You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the target usually gets a saving
throw. The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the target
makes the saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells.
~

0 'CAUSE LIGHT' 'CAUSE SERIOUS' 'CAUSE CRITICAL' 'HARM'~
HARMFUL GROUP~
Syntax: cast 'cause light'    <victim>
Syntax: cast 'cause serious'  <victim>
Syntax: cast 'cause critical' <victim>
Syntax: cast harm             <victim>

These spells inflict damage on the victim.  The higher-level spells do
more damage.
~

0 'CHAIN LIGHTNING'~
CHAIN LIGHTNING~
Usage: cast 'chain lightning' <target>

Chain lightning produces a powerful lightening bolt which arcs from
target to victim in the room until its force is exhausted. The caster's 
allies may be hit if they are members of a clan. The caster will not be
struck unless no other victims remain in the room. Chain lightning is
most effective on groups of creatures.
~

0 'CHAMELEON'~
OBFUSCATE~
Usage: obfuscate

OBFUSCATE succeeds SNEAK and HIDE by mimicking chameleon like
abilities to blend into environments from room to room. Beware! You
might not always blend in properly when entering a new room. Hazardous,
if inhabited by aggressive monsters.
~

0 'CHAMELEON'~
OBFUSCATE~
Syntax: Obfuscate
 
Being in this form, makes you undetectable. Basically ensuring your
chance to backstab.
~

~

0 'CHANNEL'~
Channel~
Syntax: cast channel <victim>

~

0 'CHARM PERSON'~
CHARM PERSON~
Usage: cast 'charm person' <target> 
 
Charm person places the target under the caster's control if cast
successfully, otherwise, it will initiate a fight. The command
"order" will make the charmed follower do your bidding. The caster is
responsible for his/her followers' actions. Attack on a caster's 
charmed follower(s) will warrant a penalty as if a direct attack was 
launched on the caster.
 
{R*{w  Please note that all pk rules apply to the treatment and use of
charmed players, particularly concerning looting and use in pk. 
Use common sense or else you will eventually incur the wrath of an

The circle skill allows an expert thief to get behind an opponent
and do extra damage similar to backstab.  You may circle anyone
that is currently fighting you.  Once your opponent's hit points
drop to a low percent, you will no longer be able to circle unless
the victim can not see you.

get circled, but attacks cannot be initiated with circle.

CLANS~
{w 1. Do NOT join any clan until you investigate ALL clans.{x
 
 2. Once you join a clan, you must STAY WITH THAT Clan.  No switching
    clans, abandoning your clan mates, etc.; the point of joining a
    clan is to use TEAMWORK.  That means when you get pkilled, you
    your CLAN MATES to retrieve your corpse, re-equip you, help you
    avenge your death, etc.  Do not count on the IMMs for help.
 
 3. You may not have multiple characters in multiple clans.  If you
    choose to have more than one character clanned, you must have
    them in the same clan, or as condemned.

 4. If you get pkilled, you will *NOT* be reimbursed ANY eq by the
    Immortals.  This includes items of sentimental value and quest
    items, etc.
 
 5. Clanned characters are not allowed to ask for or receive ANY kind
    of Immortal related help.  This includes corpse retrievals,
    spellups, assistance locating chars, reimbursements, etc.
 
 6. If you are a clan leader, you are expected to MUD on a regular
    basis.  If you do not actively play your character for three weeks,
    and have not found a replacement, you will be removed as leader or
    your clan will be deleted.
 
 7. To form a new clan, you must have 50 cubics (see help prices).
    Also, must submit the following before purchase.
     * 3 room descriptions for your starting rooms.
     * 1 two-way link anywhere in realm.
     * A one line description of your clan, for clist.
     * A name, short/long description of your banker.
     * A name, short/long description for your donation pit.
     * Your clan help file. (See help clan_helpfile)
     * 10 clan ranks.

0 'CLAN_HELPFILE'~
CLAN HELP FILES~
All clans must submit a help file about their clan.  The following
format is required.  
 
Desc: (A brief 20 line max description of the clan goes here)
(Space)
Extended Desc: A little message saying, please see help 
clan_(clan)_history1, or clan_(clan)_desc1 goes here. For a longer

CLERICS~
Clerics are the most defensively orientated of all classes.  Most of
their spells focus on healing or defending the faithful, with their few
combat spells being far less powerful than those of mages. However,
clerics are the best class by far at healing magics, and possess an
impressive array of protective magics, as well as fair combat prowess.

All clerics begin with skill in the mace.  Other weapon or shield
skills must be purchased, many at a very dear cost.  The default
skill selection for clerics is as follows:

skills:
flail          the proper use of flails

spell groups:

The clone command duplicates an object or mobile.  The level of item or
mobile that may be cloned depends on your level.  The target object or
mob must be in the same room as you, or in your possession.  Strung and
set information is preserved by clone, as well as any spell effects and
container contents or mobile inventory, except for items which are too
high for you to clone.  Strung extended descriptions on objects are not

Usage: color <channel> #   Sets channel color to #

The list option lists all color configurable channels and color
numbers used to configure default, and channel colors.

A number as the only argument sets default color to this number.
Default color applies to most text that is displayed on the MUD.

A channel name as the first argument, with a number as second
argument, sets the channel to the color (number). Example: color
gossip 2 (Default bright blue gossip channel becomes default green.)

The following 'escape character' (left braces '{{') and color numbers
can be used before sentences as well as between words and letters to  
bring color to your titles, pretitle, whostrings, and restrings.

avoiding being blinded by a dirt kick.
~

0 'DISARM'~
DISARM~
Usage: disarm <target>
Usage: disarm

Usage: cast {$cancellation {w<victim>
 
{1DISPEL EVIL {winvokes Thoth's wrath on {1evil{w aligned victims. Casters
not pure of heart may dangerously affect themselves with this spell.

{^DISPEL GOOD{w invokes Belan's wrath on {^good {waligned victims. Casters
pure of heart may dangerously affect themselves with this spell.

{#DISPEL MAGIC{w removes {#magical{w affects from the victim without regard
to whether the affects are helpful or harmful. {#DISPEL MAGIC{w initiates
attacks and is somewhat effective as opposed to {$CANCELLATION{w.

{$CANCELLATION {wremoves {#magical{w affects from the victim, without regard
to whether the affects are helpful or harmful. {$CANCELLATION{w is quite
effective without initiating attacks, and can only be used on allies.

Success of dispelling is based on the level of the spell. Permanent
spells (like mobile's sanctuary) are much harder to remove. Not all
spells may be dispelled (POISON and PLAGUE are two great examples).

and 'ALL.object' for all objects with the same name.

0 'DRUID' 'DRUID BASICS' 'DRUID DEFAULT'~
DRUIDS~
Druids are the protectors of nature.  Some spend their lives in
forests, others in deserts, and some still in seas or mountainous
regions.  Where a druid can be closer to nature and life than to the
constructs of mortals, that druid can be happy.

They control a very powerful blend of magic, potent healing spells and
devastating combat spells, but they don't have transportation spells,
as they are not well suited for it.

lore            the lore of magical items

0 'ELECTRICAL STORM'~
ELECTRICAL STORM~

0 'ELEMENTAL GROUP' 'THUNDERBOLT' 'GLACIER' 'INCINERATE'~
ELEMENTAL GROUP~
Usage: cast  {Bthunderbolt {7| {^glacier {7| {!incinerate  {g<target>{7

The ELEMENTAL group of spells are used best by druids, since they are
more attuned to the elements, however high-level mages and Rangers may
also learn to wield these powerful spells.  Not only do they cause damage,
they also apply affects that last a while after the spell is cast, further
aiding the caster.  
~

0 'EMOTE' 'PMOTE' 'POSE' 'SOCIAL'~
EXPRESSION~
Syntax: emote <action>
Syntax: pose

EMOTE is used to express emotions or actions.  Besides EMOTE, there are
several dozen built-in social commands, such as CACKLE, HUG, and THANK
(type socials or help socials for a listing).

PMOTE is similar to emote, but will substitute you and your for a
target's name (i.e. pmote bonks Alander will be read as bonks you by
Alander, and as bonks Alander by everyone else).

POSE produces a random message depending on your class and level.
~

0 'EMPOWER'~
EMPOWER~
Syntax: cast empower <spell>

This spell magically binds another spell to either a scroll, or a
potion, depending on the type of spell being bound.  This spell
can be quite costly in terms of mana, since not only does it use
mana for this spell, but also for the spell being bound.
~

0 'ENCHANT ARMOR' 'ENCHANT WEAPON'~
ENCHANT ARMOR - ENCHANT WEAPON~
Usage: cast 'enchant armor' <object>
Usage: cast 'enchant weapon' <weapon>

reliable as ENCHANT WEAPON, and is much more prone to destructive
affects. Successful enchants increase the plus of the armor by 1 or
2 points, and raises it's level by 1.
 
ENCHANT WEAPON magically enchants a weapon to increase it's to-hit
and to-dam bonuses by 1 or 2 points, and raises it's level by 1.
Multiple enchants may be cast, but as the weapon grows more and more
powerful, it is likely to be drained or destroyed by the magic.

ENERGY DRAIN~

ENERGY DRAIN saps experience, mana, and movement points from a victim.
~

0 'ENHANCED DAMAGE'~
ENHANCED DAMAGE~
Warriors and skilled thieves can become skilled enough in combat that
they are able to inflict more damage than other classes.  Enhanced
damage is checked for with each hit, although with a low skill, the
chance of receiving a bonus is very low indeed.
~

0 'ENHANCEMENT'~

often have harmful effects upon the recipient.

~

0 'ENTANGLE'~
ENTANGLE~
The entangle spell is a druid spell which when cast on a target renders them
unable to move for a specified amount of time.  
~

0 'ENVENOM'~
ENVENOM~
The envenom skill is a cowardly skill practiced only by thieves,
designed to win a battle through alchemy and treachery rather than skill
or strength.  Or, put another way, it's a skill used by the smart to kill
the foolish.  Food, drink, and weapons may be envenomed, with varying
effects. Poisoned food or drink puts a mild poison spell on the consumer,
and is unlikely to be more than a minor inconvenience (after all, the
typical adventurer could drink sewer water with only a trace of the runs).
A poisoned weapon, on the other hand, can inflict serious damage on an
opponent as the poison burns through his bloodstream.  But be careful,
blade venom evaporates quickly and is rendered almost powerless by
repeated blows in combat.

0 'EQUIPMENT' 'INVENTORY'~
EQUIPMENT/INVENTORY~

0 'EXOTIC' 'WEAPONS' 'WEAPON' 'WEAPONSMASTER' 'AXE' 'DAGGER' 'FLAIL' 'MACE' 'POLEARM' 'SPEAR' 'SWORD' 'WHIP'~
WEAPONS~
Each weapon skill applies to a specific group of arguments, and
determines how well a character fights with a particular weapon. The
'Weaponsmaster' group provides talent in all weapons (except exotics),
from chair legs to halberds. If the character also has the parry skill,
they can parry incoming attacks.  The chance of parrying is best if the
character in question is skilled at both his/her, and opponents weapons.

The weapon skills consist of the following:

Weaponsmaster Skill group of all weapons listed below (except exotics)
Axe           Use of axes ranging from hand axe to great axe
Dagger        Use of knives, daggers, and other stabbing weapons
Flail         Use of ball-and-chain type weapons
Mace          Use of clubs, hammers, and maces

level.
~

0 'EXPERIENCE' 'LEVEL' 'XP'~
EXPERIENCE~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need a set 
amount of experience points for each level based on your creation
points.

You gain experience by:

    being part of a group that kills a monster

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many
players are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster;
your alignment versus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster
have been killed lately; and some random variation.
~

0 'FAERIE FIRE'~
FAERIE FIRE~

0 'FAST HEALING'~
FAST HEALING~
The fast healing skill improves wound healing rates, whether walking,
resting, or sleeping. It represents knowledge of healing herbs or just
general toughness and stamina.  Fast healing is checked every tick, and
it is possible for it to fail.  All class may learn this skill, but
mages find it very difficult to master, due to their bookish lifestyle.

Showers everyone in the room with a deadly storm of fire, inflicting
damage on everyone inside the room.  
~

0 'FIREPROOF'~
FIREPROOF~
Usage: cast fireproof <object>

FIREPROOF temporarily creates a protective aura around the specified
object. Affects of acid, flame, and the HEAT METAL spell do no damage
to items protected by FIREPROOF. While cheap to use, the short life
of protection makes for impractical use on large numbers of objects.
~

0 'FLAGS'~
FLAGS~
The following are the description flags for players and mobiles:
      {x({yV{DH{cC{bT{wP{RE{YG{GQ{x)-({gA{YD{CI{rF{BL{wP{yR{WS{GT{RV{x)

~

0 'FLEE'~
FLEE~
Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue   <player>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the
fight is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another
player can RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less 
likely to work, and costs more experience points than fleeing.).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more
experience.
~

0 'FLOATING DISC'~
FLOATING DISK~
Usage: cast 'floating disc'

The FLOATING DISC spell creates a disc of floating energy which
acts as a temporary container. The FLOATING CLOSE position in the
caster's equipment list MUST have NOTHING in it, or else this spell
fails. The floating disc holds (10 pounds)x(caster's level), max of
5 pounds per item, lasts just less than 2x(caster's level), and
does not add to caster's items/weight carried. Death, and energy
expiring from the disc are the only 2 ways to lose the disc.
~

0 'FLY'~
FLY~
Usage: cast 'fly' <target>

FLY lets you fly (obviously). While flying, you can cross bodies
of water as well as travel airborne over deep ravines, canyons, etc.
~

0 'FOLLOW' 'GROUP'~
FOLLOW / GROUP~
Syntax: follow <player>
Syntax: group
Syntax: group <player>

FOLLOW starts you following another player.  To stop following anyone
else, just FOLLOW <self>.

GROUP <player> makes someone who is following you a member of your
group.  Group members share experience points from kills and may use
the GTELL and SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked,
you will automatically join the fight.

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave
your group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your
group.

You may only GROUP characters who are within 10 levels of your own.
~

103 'FORCE'~
FORCE~
Syntax: force <character> <command>
Syntax: force all <command>

FORCE forces one character to execute a command except delete.

Below level 107 force can only be used on mobiles, and force all
is unavailable.  You also cannot 'force orc murder hugo', for example.

FORGE~
Syntax: forge list < NULL / all | stone type >
Syntax: forge <stone type> <item>
 Forging stones may be randomly collected via killing mobs.  These

to the blacksmith to have the stones forged into the equipment and/or
weapon(s).  
~

0 'FORGET' 'REMEMBER'~

Use either command without an argument for a list of players currently
forgotten.
~

106 'FREEZE'~
FREEZE~
Syntax: freeze <name>

FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing
any commands at all. It can be removed from within the game, so freezing
a troublemaker is usually a better option than they deny command.
~

0 'FRENZY'~
FRENZY~
Syntax: cast 'frenzy' <target>

The frenzy spell fills the target with righteous fury, greatly
increasing his or her attack skill and damaging capacity.
Unfortunately, this divine wrath is coupled with a tendency to ignore
threats to personal safety, making the target easier to hit.  Frenzy
provides immunity to the calm spell (see 'help calm'), and may only be
used on those of the caster's alignment.
~

0 'GAIN'~
GAIN~
The gain command is used to learn new skills, once the proper trainer
has been found. (Check New Thalos) The following options can be used
with gain:

gain list:    list all groups and skills that can be learned
gain points:  lower your creation points by 1 (costs two sessions)
gain <name>:  add a skill or skill group, at the listed cost
gain convert: turns 6 practices into one training session
gain study:   turns 1 training session into 6 practices

Gain uses training sessions, not practices. (see 'help train')
Gained skills and groups do NOT increase your experience per level or
total number of creation points. 
~

GATE - PORTAL - NEXUS~
Usage: cast <{@gate{&|{%portal{&|{#nexus{w> <target>

{@GATE{w creates a one way portal which transports the caster and their
pets through to the target, whom is not more than 3 levels above the 
caster. Other members of the casters group won't be transported. God
rooms, private rooms, and no_recall rooms cannot be gated into, and
no_recall rooms cannot be gated out of. Gods, Heroes, and players with
NOSUMMON toggled on, cannot be gated to. Clan members may not be
gated to by anyone other than fellow clan members.

{%PORTAL{w creates a one way portal to the target, allowing the caster and
others to walk thru to the target. To enter a portal, type ENTER
PORTAL or GO PORTAL. Portals cannot be created to targets in certain
locations, nor be used to escape portal and gate proof rooms. Special
sources of power are required in order to create portals. The secret
of the source however, has been lost in time...
 
{#Nexus{w Is identical to {%PORTAL{w except for one thing, it is a two
way portal, rather than one way. It also lasts longer than {%PORTAL{w.

102 'GOTO'~
GOTO~
Syntax: goto
        goto <location>

Goto takes you to a location.  The location may be specified as a vnum,
as the name of a mobile, or as the name of an object.

Goto with no argument will take you to your default location if you
have one set. (see GSET)  If used in this manner, your pet will be
transferred with you.

You may not Goto a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more)
characters already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more)
characters already present. Some other rooms are barred to players
below a certain god level.

Implementors can use the violate command to get into private rooms.
~

0 'GOUGE'~
GOUGE~
Usage: gouge <target>
Usage: gouge

GOUGE is a great way to attempt to blind your opponent via literally
using your fingers to GOUGE their eyes. The blindness may not last
long, but provides a significant edge in combat. Gouge can be used
to initiate combat, while in combat, and if fighting multiple opponents
can target which opponent gets their eyes gouged. CURE BLINDNESS
and RUB do not work effectively at removing this type of blindness.
 
Who would have thought the 3 stooges knew what they were doing?!

GROUP INFO CP~
The ROT skill system allows you to fully customize your new character,
making him or her skilled in the skills you choose.  But beware, the
skills you pick at character creation are the only skills you will ever
learn.  Skills are paid for with creation points, and the more creation
points you have, the harder it is to gain a level.  Furthermore, higher-
cost skills are harder to practice.

Skill groups are like package deals for characters -- sets of skills or
spells that are closely related, and hence can be learned as a unit.
There is a default skill group for each class, which can be selected for
a balanced selection of skills at a somewhat reduced cost.

The experience breakdown is as follows: 
points   exp/level     points   exp/level
40        1000         90        6000
50        1500         100       8000

80        4000         130      24000
The table continues in a similar manner for higher point totals.

0 'GROUP_COMBAT'~
COMBAT GROUP~
These sorcerous spells are, in the words of one famous mage, just
'more ways to toss energy around'.  They are the most powerful of
the damaging spells, and considered an essential part of most wizards'
collections. Clerics and thieves do not have access to these spells.
In order of power, the combat spell group contains the following magics:

magic missile   send a weak energy bolt into a foe
chill touch     weakens your enemy with a frigid grasp
burning hands   sends a blast of fire into your foe
shocking grasp  sends a powerful jolt into a foe
lightning bolt  sends forth a single bolt of lightning into an enemy
colour spray    blasts your target w/rainbow spray, which may blind 
fireball        a powerful spell, great for burning your enemy to ashes
acid blast      sends forth a stream of acid to eradicate your foes
chain lightning sends lightning bolts arcing through foes

~

0 'HAGGLE' 'HAGGLING'~
HAGGLE~
Haggling is an indispensable skill to a trader. It allows a character
to match wits with a merchant, seeking to get a better price for
merchandise, or to buy at the lowest possible cost.  Unfortunately,
most merchants are already very skilled at haggling, so the untrained
adventurer had best guard their treasure closely.  Thieves are natural
masters at haggling, although other classes may learn it as well.
 
HAGGLE is an automatic skill once practiced.
~

0 'HAND TO HAND'~
HAND TO HAND~
Hand to hand combat is a rare skill in the lands of Devious 
Abandonment.  Learning this style of fighting gives the player
a weapon even when disarmed -- bare hands.  Trained hand to hand
experts are far more effective than many swordsmen.  Clerics and 
warriors are the best at this skill, although thieves and mages 
may also learn it.
 
Hand to Hand is an automatic skill as are other weapons.
 
See also, HELP WEAPONS.
~

0 'HARMFUL'~
HARMFUL~
This spell group is the opposite of healing.  The harmful spells are
designed to tear flesh from bone, rupture arteries, and generally
turn the body against itself.  Only priests and warriors may use this

cause light     inflicts minor wounds on an enemy
cause serious   inflicts wounds on a foe
cause critical  causes major damage to the target
harm            the most deadly harmful spell
~

0 'HASTE'~
HASTE~
Syntax: cast 'haste' <target>

The haste spell increases the speed and agility of the recipient,
allowing an extra attack (or even a backstab) in combat, and improving
evasive abilities in combat.  However, it produces a great strain on
the system, such that recuperative abilities are halved.  Haste is
capable of negating the slow spell. (see 'help slow').

~

0 'HEAT METAL'~
HEAT METAL~
Syntax: cast 'heat metal' <target>

Heat metal is a powerful sage attack spell, with effects that vary 
according to the armor of the victim.  It heats up the metal equipment
(assumed to be all weapons and armor at this point in time) on the
target, causing him/her to drop them if possible, taking serious burns
in the process (possibly fatal if the equipment is too heavy to remove
easily).  This spell does no damage to creatures who are immune to fire.

0 'HEROTALK'~
HEROTALK~
This channel is reserved for players that are level 101 or above only.
You can talk to every hero on the mud with this channel.  This channel
is very useful for asking for help with getting equipment and other

~

0 'HOLD' 'REMOVE' 'WEAR' 'WIELD' 'SECOND' 'DUAL'~
OBJECT WEARING~
Usage: hold    <object>
Usage: remove  <object|all>
Usage: wear    <object|all>
Usage: wield   <object>
Usage: second  <object>

HOLD, WEAR, WIELD, and SECOND will take specified objects from your
inventory and start using it as equipment. HOLD is for lights, wands,
and staves. WEAR is for armor while WIELD and SECOND is for weapons.

WEAR ALL will put all HOLD, WEAR, and WIELD suitable items from your
inventory to you body. REMOVE ALL does exactly the opposite. Cursed
and non-remove items are more difficult to deal with in such removal
manners. Consulting your local Healer may help you to uncurse them.

You can WEAR or REMOVE individual items by typing WEAR <item> or
REMOVE <item>.

You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment
does not match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not
experienced enough to use it properly.

REMOVE will take any object from your equipment and put it back into
your inventory.
 
NOTE: Use SECOND to wield second weapons, not dual. It don't work that
way!
~

0 'HOLY WORD'~
HOLY WORD~
Syntax: cast 'holy word'

Holy word involves the invocation of the full power of a cleric's god,
with disastrous effects upon the enemies of the priest coupled with
powerful blessings on the priest's allies.  All creatures of like
alignment in the room are blessed and filled with righteous divine wrath,
while those of opposite morals (or both good and evil in the case of
neutral priests) are struck down by holy (or unholy might) and cursed. 
The cleric suffers greatly from the strain of this spell, being left
unable to move and drained of vitality.  Experience loss is no longer
associated with the spell.
~

102 'HOLYLIGHT' 'INVIS' 'WIZINVIS'~
WIZINVIS~
Syntax: holylight
        wiznvis <level>

Holylight is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character
and mob in the game.  With holylight, you can see what's in the game
more easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

Wizinvis takes a level argument, and will make you invisible to all
players of a lower level than your invisibility level.  It defaults
to the maximum (your level) if no argument is given.  Wizi 110
characters are totally invisible.

ICICLE~
Usage: cast icicle <target>
 
This spell creates an icicle to strike at the target.
~

102 'IDENTITY'~
IDENTITY~
Syntax: Identity (what ever you want everyone else to see you as)
 
This skill is a very nice skill that allows the person to change hide his/her
identity from everyone.  They wont know who you are, only you know who you are.
It makes it so that when you talk they will only see what your fake identity is
and not your real identity name.
~

0 'ILLUSION'~
ILLUSION~
The illusions spells are dedicated to deception and trickery.  They
can be used to mask appearances, or create distractions for the party.
Currently, the illusion group is very small, but it will be expanded
in the future.  Only thieves and mages can cast illusion spells, which
consist of the following:

invis           turns the target invisible
mass invis      turns the caster's group invisible
ventriloquate   allows the caster to put words in someone's mouth
~

0 'IMMORTAL' 'GOD' 'WIZ'~
IMMORTALS~
'Immortal' (often, simply, 'immort') refers to players who have reached
the highest attainable levels in the game.  Here, anyone of level 102
or higher is an 'immortal.'  Immortals are capable of exceeding the
usual game rules, in more drastic and pervasive ways as levels increase;
examples range from teleportation and invisibility to mortal sight to
creation of objects, removal of a player's privileges (channels,
ability to move, or even ability to log in), and ability to promote
players to immortality.

Since immortals can wreak havoc with game balance, they are (ideally)
a carefully-chosen and policed group.  An absolute rule of immortal
behavior is that no immortal can aid or assist any player without
explicit permission from the higher ranks; in other words, please
don't ask an immortal to help you kill a mob, gather EQ, etc, or
you'll likely be either politely or rudely refused, or referred to
this file.

The duties of immortals, and even the very reasons for their existence,
are topics of continual and heated debate in many MUD forums, and are
fraught with misconceptions, poor examples, and outrageous hypocrisies. :)
~

102 'IMMTALK' ':'~
IMMTALK~
Syntax: immtalk <message>
{w        immtalk

Immtalk sends a message to all immortals.  : is a synonym for immtalk.

turns it back on).

102 'INCOGNITO' 'GHOST'~
INCOG / GHOST~
Toggling your incognito status will hide your presence from people
outside the room you are in, but leave you visible to those who are
with you.  Toggling your ghost status will do the exact opposite,
making you invisible to anyone in the same room as you, but visible to

visible to all characters in the game through the 'who' command.

The load command is used to load new objects or mobiles (use clone
to  duplicate strung items and mobs).  The vnums can be found with
the vnum command, or by stat'ing an existing mob or object.

Load puts objects in inventory if they can be carried, otherwise they
are put in the room.  Mobiles are always put into the same room as the
god. Old format objects must be given a level argument to determine

LOG / SNOOP~
Syntax: log   <character>
	log   all
	snoop <character>

Log <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like Freeze, it is a permanent character toggle.
Logs may only be used by creators and implementors, and should be
accompanied by mail to the implementors.

Certain commands (Password) are protected against log.  Conversely,
certain commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

Log all logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it
does not persist across reboots. Please do not use this unless you
tell the imps.

Snoop shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time. Try to respect privacy.

Snoop yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.
~

0 'LONG'~
LONG~
The LONG command will affect the way you see special flags on other
characters and equipment.  With the long flag set, you will see the

Without the long flag (default), you will see any flags within
a much shorter table.  See 'HELP FLAGS' for the shorter tables.
~

0 'LOOPHOLE'~
LOOPHOLE~
{RLoophole{w (n): "A way of escaping a difficulty, especially an omission 
{wor ambiguity in the wording of a contract or law that provides a means
{wof evading compliance. "{x
 
Exploiting loopholes will not be tolerated since this is often viewed 
as cheating and is about the quickest way to incur the immortals' 
wrath. Loopholes are to be treated as bugs and reported. Failure to 
report known loopholes will result in severe penalties up to and
including permanent site ban. Big brother is watching YOU!
~

0 'LORE'~
LORE~
Usage: Lore <object>

Lore is a general skill which utilizes knowledge of myths and legends.
Use of the lore skill gives a chance of obtaining information on an
object, concerning its power and uses.  It may occasionally increase
the value of an object, because more will be known about its worth.
All classes may learn lore, although thieves are best at it, and
warriors find it very hard to use.
~

0 'LUNGE'~
LUNGE~
Usage: lunge <target>
 
The art of lunging is an old warrior trait that is almost instinctual. To lunge, one
must be wielding a sword.
~

0 'MAGE' 'MAGIC-USER' 'MAGE BASICS' 'MAGE DEFAULT'~
MAGES~
Mages specialize in the casting of spells, offensive ones in
particular. Mages have the highest-powered magic of any other class
of it's level, and the only one able to use draconian and enchanting
spell groups. They are also very skilled at the use of magical items,
though their combat skills are the weakest of any class.

Mages make great allies to bands of fighters. With the fighters doing
the up close hand to hand combat, Mages can help obliterate enemies
via casting their range of offensive spells to help make the enemy
less effective in combat, thus making them more likely to die.

See also: CHECKSTATS CLASS MAGE for a list of skills and spells.
~

0 'MALADICTIONS'~
Maladictions~
Maladictions are a group of curses and other baneful spells, designed
to cripple, inconvenience, or torture, rather than kill outright.  These

~

0 'MANA SHIELD' 'MANASHIELD'~
MANA-SHIELD~
Usage: cast 'mana shield'

chance of absorbing some of the damage to be inflicted upon the caster
during combat. Success of the shielding is not guaranteed against
every instance of damage dealt.

spell on all players in the room.  It also throws in a refresh spell
for good measure.
~

0 'MEDITATION'~
MEDITATION~
Usage: meditate

MEDITATION is like FAST HEALING, but for mana rather than health. It
relies on deep concentration to increase mana recovery while sleeping
or resting. Fighter type classes (Rogue, Thief, Mercenary, Wanderer,
Warrior, and Gladiators) have the most trouble learning meditate due
to their minds being focused on war and violence.
~

0 'MEMBER'~
MEMBER~
Syntax: member <char>        Invites or removes a member from your clan.
        member <accept|deny> Accept / deny an invitation to join a clan.

to actually become a member of that clan.  Use the DENY option if you
do not wish to join the clan in question.
~

102 'MEMORY'~

*** Reminder, You can make mobiles higher than 200
*** These Charts are based mostly upon the level of the area. So if you
    make a level 200 area with level 225 mobs, you can give them the level
    200 stats. Same thing if your making a level 100 area, with 115
    mobiles. You can give the mobiles level 100 stats.
*** A couple thousand hp here or there doesn't really matter, but try to keep
    near the chart.
*** Do NOT go over 30k hp on a mobile.
*** You might consider give these mobs on this list a couple more levels
    with the same hp as the orginal level. Good for some xp.

Thief* mobiles should read their hp, ac, and damage at one level lower
Mage mobiles read hp and ac at one level lower, and damage three levels lower
Cleric mobiles read damage at two levels lower
Warrior mobiles read hit points one level higher

MPROG~
{w To make things come alive, variables are needed.  These are
represented in the MOBprograms by using a dollar sign convention as
in the socials. When the mud command is processed, these variables are
expanded into the values shown below. Usually, it is best to use the
short descriptions of mobiles and the names of players when speaking
them, but if you are performing an action to someone almost always you
want the name. The title field for players is an extra that probably wont
often be used.  Without further hesitation... the variables:

$i      the first of the names of the mobile itself.
$I      the short description of the mobile itself.
$n      the name of whomever caused the trigger to happen.
$N      the name and title of whomever caused the trigger to happen.
$t      the name of a secondary character target (i.e A smiles at B)
$T      the short description, or name and title of target (NPC vs PC)
$r      the name of a random PC in the room with the mobile
$R      the short description, or name and title of the random PC
$q      the name of the MOBprogram target (see MOB REMEMBER)
$Q      the short description of the MOBprogram target

$S      his,hers,its based on sex of $t.
$L      his,hers,its based on sex of $r.

$o      the first of the names of the primary object
$O      the short description of the primary object
$p      the first of the names of the secondary object
$P      the short description of the secondary object

        Also, in if_checks, the accepted variables are the basic ones
(i,n,t,r,o,p,q).  If a variable is referenced that doesn't exist, then
the value is simply left blank or replaced with "someone"/"something"
in output (i.e referring to $o when the trigger is: A kisses B)

NOEMOTE, NOSHOUT, and NOTELL are used to muffle other characters, by
preventing them from emoting, shouting, and telling, respectively.
Characters who are noshout'ed or no'telled will also not receive those
forms of communication.

The NOCHANNEL command is similar, but more drastic. It prevents the
victim from using any of the channels (gossip, cgossip, Q/A, music)
on the game.  Nochannels usually result from swearing or spamming on
public channels.

The NORESTORE command makes a player immune to the restore command.
This is used to punish players who constantly ask for restores from
immortals.

The NOCLAN command makes a player unable to join pkill-type clans.
This is used to punish players who are known to cause serious troubles
with pkilling.

The NOTITLE command makes a player unable to set their own title.
This is used to punish players who use the title for swearing,
threats, etc....

When you log in, you will be informed if there are unread notes waiting.
Type note read to scroll through them one at a time.

Four other note directories exist, these are ideas, news, changes,

{cstarting your area and  ending up with a spaghetti of rooms, mobs 
{cand/or objects, map it out on paper. I find it easiest to map out the

102 'OLC_ALIST''ALIST'~
OLC_ALIST~
Syntax: ALIST
        ALIST <keyword>
        ALIST <vnum>

This command gives you a listing of all the areas along with their
vnum assignments and the builder(s) assigned to editing them. 
Alist with a keyword argument displays all areas with names matching
your argument.  Alist with a vnum argument displays the area which
the vnum belongs to.  
~

102 'OLC_AVERAGEDAMAGE'~
OLC Average Damage~
{DThe way average damage works is based off the level of the weapon. 
Max damage is level + level/10. Min damage is level - level/10. So
Example level 100 weapon, max average is 100 + 100/10, which is 100+10
so 110, where the min is 90. Two-handers would be lvl*1.3. 
~

102 'OLC_COST'~
COST OF EQUIPMENT~
Cost:
The cost of equipment is broken down as follows.
For a cost between level*401 - level*500 = 15 points
For a cost between level*301 - level*400 = 10 points
For a cost between level*201 - level*300 = 5 points
For a cost between level*101 - level*200 = 3 points
For a cost between level*1 - level*100 = 0 points
 
So hero eq paying 15 points can get a cost between. 40501-50500. Which
equals about 4-5 plat.
Remember I approve areas first, so if high cost eq is on easy mobs or
shit like that, guess you wasted your time :)

102 'OLC_MOB'~
Olc_Mob~
When making mobiles, some things to remember, don't make level 40
mobs have hero eq.  And don't make hero mobs have level 40 eq. 
Basically for mobiles, you can build the mobile around the equipment
that you intend the area to house.  So if the eq is level 50, have the
mobiles around 55-75.  Basically the equipment level + 5-25.  So hero eq
will have mobs at level 126.  For the hp...  Mana and affects.  Be
reasonable I'll prol make some charts here soon, But if you want to test
out experience, or how hard mobiles are let me know...  We'll do that.. 
After the whole area is revised cause that'll be the last part.  
 
For mob levels 20-100. The stats are picked by the level of the
mobile.
Three different types of mobs. Easy/Medium/Hard. For easy mobiles.
there will be different formulas to follow.
Hitdice/Damdice/Manadice will work like this.
The first die + the second die must = the level of the mobile
with the first die being greater than the second for med/hard mobs
the first die must be less than the second for easy mobs.

locations that an object can be loaded to.  The [<max #>] is the maximum
number of mobiles allowed in this room and will default to 1 if no number
is entered.

For resets to be successful make sure that you add them in a logical
order.  For example if you are equipping a mobile don't load a container
in the room and fill it with some objects and then continue equipping the
mobile.  It is likely that resets will backfire if they are not carefully
entered.

If you wish to reset the room then use REDIT RESET
 
Note: The percentage a mob or object will reset may be specified. If a the
percentage is not specified, it will default to 100.
 
Example:
RESET 1 MOB 1000 2 1 80
 
Please note that the resets will load in reverse order when viewing the room
with the exception of pet shops which will load in order of pet levels.
 
{R    Please ask for assistance if you are not sure how to do resets!{x

perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are
responsible for the actions of your followers, and others who attack
your followers will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you
directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggressive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.

PARRY~
If at first you fail to dodge, block it.  Parry is useful to deflect
attacks, and is more successful than dodge. Parry requires a weapon

be used but will reduce damage rather than eliminate it. Parrying is
best achieved if the defender is skilled in the weapon types wielded by 
themselves and their opponents.
 
PARRY is an automatic skill once practiced.

0 'QUEST' 'QUESTS' 'AQUEST' 'AUTOQUEST'~
QUEST~
Certain characters in the game will allow you to go on quests to recover
an item or kill another mob. To go on a quest, you must be in the same
room with a questmaster. When you successfully complete a quest, you
will receive a certain number of quest points. These points may be
saved up and used to buy incredible items from the questmaster.

The {GQUEST{w command is used for information about your current quest,
to request a quest from a questmaster, etc. Commands are as follows:

{GQUEST POINTS{w - Gives your current number of quest points. This command
may be used anywhere.

{GQUEST INFO{w - If you are on a quest, this will remind you who or what
you are after.

{GQUEST TIME{w - Gives the amount of time remaining on your current quest,
or the amount of time until you can request another quest. This command
may be used anywhere.

{GQUEST REQUEST{w - Petitions the questmaster to send you on a quest. If
you accept the quest, you will be given a realtime limit (in minutes) in
which you must complete the quest. If you are on a quest to kill a
creature, when you come across that creature you will see a {R[TARGET]{x
notice before it. This is the creature you are to kill.

{GQUEST COMPLETE{w - Once you have completed your quest and recovered the
item or killed the mob or whatever, you must return to the questmaster

completed your quest, he will reward you with gold and quest points.
Once you complete a quest you cannot request another for 10 minutes.

questmaster.  These items are not buyable via gold, they must be
purchased with quest points.

the cost of the item from your quest points.

{GQUEST FAIL{w - This command is use to cancel a quest which you can not
complete or do not wish to complete.
~

0 'QUIT' 'RENT' 'SAVE'~
QUIT / SAVE~
Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: RENT ... not!
Syntax: SAVE

SAVE saves your character and object.  The game saves your character
every 15 minutes regardless, and is the preferred method of saving.

Some objects, such as keys and potions, may not be saved.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere.  When you re-enter the
game you will be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with
just one command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.
If you get into the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play
some other mud that doesn't save before quitting, you're going to
regret it.

There is no RENT in this mud.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want
to leave.

checkstat race <name> and help <race name>.
~

0 'RANGER' 'RANGER BASICS' 'RANGER DEFAULT'~
RANGERS~
Rangers are traveling warrior-druids, usually solitary and aloof.
They are often the protectors of those far from home, travelers who
are lost, or even bounty hunters who track criminals in order to bring
them to justice or just to make a buck.  They are sometimes used as
scouts for armies, and sometimes make up their own force in times of
war.

Rangers don't have the pure combat effectiveness of warriors, and
lack the total control of druidic magic that druids possess, but the
combination of those disciplines makes them a class to be reckoned
with.

skills:
backstab        the art of hitting your opponent by surprise
enhanced damage this skill multiplies your damage in battle
parry           the art of parrying with weapons
shield block    the art of parrying with a shield
weaponsmaster   this group provides knowledge of all weapon types

spell groups:
curative        spells that cure the sick and feeble of their ailments
healing         spells for treating wounds, from scratches to death blows
transportation  spells for getting from here to there
weather         spells for conjuring and mastering the elements
~

0 'RAY OF DECEIT'~
RAY OF DECEIT~
Usage: cast 'ray of deceit' <target>
 
Ray of deceit is similar to ray of truth; however it opens a portal to the
planes of negative energy, rather than positive energy. This brings forth
a beam of pure horror that can also take the sight of the victim. The
victim of the spell is less affected by it if they follow the path of
darkness; however the caster has to be evil to control the spell, lest be
struck by it themselves.
~

0 'RAY OF TRUTH'~
RAY OF TRUTH~
Syntax: cast 'ray of truth' <target>

Ray of truth opens a portal to the planes of positive energy, bringing
forth a beam of light of sufficient purity to harm or or annihilate the
servants of evil.  It cannot harm the pure of heart, and will turn and
strike casters who are tainted by evil.
~

109 'REBOOT' 'SHUTDOWN'~
REBOOT~
Syntax: reboot
	shutdown

Reboot shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of fifteen seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

Shutdown shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.
~

0 'RECALL' '/'~
RECALL~
Usage: RECALL

RECALL prays to your god for miraculous transportation from where you
are back to the Temple of Life. A synonym for RECALL is '/'.
If you are a member of a clan that has it's own reincarnation room,
your god will transport you there, unless you have been labeled a
THIEF or KILLER.

RECALL costs 1/4 of your movement points.

RECALL doesn't work in certain god-forsaken rooms.  Characters afflicted
by a curse may not recall at all.
~

0 'RECHARGE'~
RECHARGE~
Usage: cast recharge <item>

RECHARGE restores energy to depleted wands and staves. Fully exhausted
wands and staves cannot be recharged. The difficulty of successful
restoration is proportional to number of charges used. Magic items can
only be recharged successfully once.
~

102 'RECOVER'~
RECOVER~
Syntax: recover <character>

Recover transfers the target character to their default recall point.
You may only recover a character who is either cursed, or is stuck in

0 'REMOVE CURSE'~
REMOVE CURSE~
Syntax: cast 'remove curse' <character>

a cursed object.  It may also be targeted on an object in the caster's
inventory, in which case it's chance of success is significantly higher.
~

0 'REPAIR'~
REPAIR~
Syntax: Repair <object>
 
Experienced travelers may employ REPAIR to fix damaged
equipment rather than needing to acquire new pieces. Be warned
however, attempts to repair equipment may damage it worse.
~

0 'REPEAT' '!'~
REPEAT~
Syntax: !

! repeats the last command you typed.
~

0 'REROLL'~
REROLL~
The reroll command may be used once you reach hero status in the first
tier of classes, or at any time while playing a second tier character.
This command must be typed twice to reroll a character, and you cannot
be forced to reroll.  Typing reroll with an argument will return your
character to 'safe' status if you change your mind after the first
reroll.

After typing reroll the second time, you will be forced to quit.  When
you reconnect, you will have to re-create your character, but will be
given the second tier classes to choose from, instead of the first tier
classes. (see 'help tier')

After rerolling, you will start out in your new class at level 1, so
this command is similar to deleting and recreating your character.
When rerolling, your current platinum, gold, silver, quest points, age,
catalystic points, pkills, pdeaths, bounty, clan, clan leader status,
and banking platinum, gold, and silver values save.  Also, any equipment
you are currently carrying will save, however you will be forced to
remove it all.
~

0 'RESCUE'~
RESCUE~
A friend in need is a friend indeed.  And when in combat, a warrior with
the rescue skill is just the friend you need.  Rescue allows you to
intercede in combat, protecting weaker characters from bodily harm.
Hopefully the favor will be returned.  Success in rescuing depends on
the skill rating, as well as a comparison of level, dexterity, and
speed between the character and the target. (note: you rescue a
friend, not the monster)
~

0 'REST' 'SLEEP' 'STAND' 'WAKE'~
POSITIONS~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.
~

106 'RESTORE'~
RESTORE~
Syntax: restore <character>
	restore room
	restore all

Restore restores full hit points, mana points, and movement points to
the target character.  It also heals poison, plague, and blindness.

Restore room (or restore with no argument) performs a restore on every
player in the room, restore all does the same for all connected players.
Restore all is only usable by creators and implementors.  Restore
should be used sparingly or not at all.
~

0 'RESURRECT'~
RESURRECT~
Syntax: cast resurrect

This spell will resurrect the first corpse in the room it finds,
turning it into a zombie.  Zombies are considered pets, and cannot be
created if you already have a pet.
~

0 'REVIVE' 'REVIVAL STONE'~

upon those who venture to near you in combat.
~

0 'ROM'~
ROM~
ROM started in early February 1993, using Merc 1.0 code. In July of
1993, ROM II was started, eventually replacing the original ROM.  ROM
was up for a little over a year, after which the code (version 2.3)
was released, and various other ROM muds were started, including
Rivers of Mud under a new management (Zump's ROM), at rom.org 9000.

Alander's current project is Tesseract, the latest version of the ROM
code.  It can be found at hypercube.org 9000.

The following people contributed to the ROM flavor of the merc base
code:

Socials --
    Kelsey and Liralen

New, Improved Valhalla --
    Liralen

Puff's new special proc and improved poofin/poofout code --
    Seth

Maps and map shop --
    Ezra, Regnan (Olympus)

Nirvana zone --
    Forstall (mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Mob Factory --
    Pinkfloyd (originally written for ROM, mobiles rewritten by
               Alander)

Geographically correct Midgaard (tm) --
    Alander

Ideas and playtesting --
    Thousands of dedicated mudders around the world

Beta testing --
    Ken Blosser, Doug Araya, and Sherene Neil all helped with bug
    reports and suggestions, saving a lot of headaches

New Thalos area was donated by Onivel of Jedi, who was also the
originator of the ASCII flags used in the zone files

ROM 2.4 was developed during my time with Moosehead mud, and the
release shares many of the features I wrote while I was there.
Additional code was written by Seth Scott (the new poofin/poofout),
and many contributions and ideas from the Merc list were used. 

The new features of 2.4 were largely produced in bull sessions with
Gabrielle (my wife) and Brian Moore, without whom this release
wouldn't have happened.  In particular, the new privacy code,
furniture, and wiznet are largely the results of Gabrielle's ideas.

Changes to the standard diku mob and object format, as well as the
changes to Merc 2.1 source code, were done by Alander over many a late
night of hair-pulling. Hope you enjoy it.

(my apologies if anyone was forgotten in this list)

0 'ROT'~
ROT~
RoT is a ROM2.4 derived mud, which is originally based on the Merc
1.0 code.  The RoT modifications to the ROM source are copyright
1996-1997 by Russ Walsh.
~

0 'RUB'~
RUB~
Usage: rub

The RUB skill allows you to attempt to rub off the blinding affects
of dirt and smoke. Dirt is easier to rub off than smoke. Rub however
will not effectively remove blinding affects from the GOUGE skill
or BLINDNESS spells. RUB generally has a high fail rate, but improves
over time, and can make a difference between life and death.

In order to use the RUB skill, you must practice the RUB skill.

0 'RUN' 'JOG 'SPRINT'~
JOG~
Syntax: jog <direction list>

The <direction list> consists of a string of directions in the
form <#d>.  "#" is optional and represents the number of times
to repeat the direction.  "d" is the direction you wish to jog.
You may also use <od> in the direction list where "o" stands for
open and "d" is the direction of the door you wish to open.

  Example:  jog 12eos3ses4w

This command is used for speedwalking from one place to another.
Once you start jogging, no other commands will be processed
until you stop.  There are only a few conditions that will
stop you from jogging.

  1.  You reach your destination.
  2.  You are unable to move to the next room.

As far as the mud is concerned, all directions processed while
jogging are received as if they were entered one at a time.
This means that anything that can happen during normal walking
can also happen while jogging.  All rooms are shown in brief
mode while jogging.

0 'SCAN' 'FARSIGHT'~
SCAN~
Usage: scan <direction>
Usage: scan
Usage: cast 'farsight'

The SCAN command allows you to detect occupants moving in adjacent
rooms. These occupants will only appear as 'Something'.

The FARSIGHT spell heightens the caster's awareness, thus allowing
creatures and players in adjacent rooms they SCAN to show up in
their real identity. If a specified direction is scanned however, 
occupants will be revealed up to a few rooms away in that direction.
Since much concentration is needed for such talent, the caster
may be unable to perform other actions for a few moments.
~

0 'SCRIBE' 'SKILL_SCRIBE'~
SCRIBE~
Usage: scribe <'spell 1'> <'spell 2'> <'spell 3'>

Spells scribed per scroll based on ink quality are: Low = 1, High = 3.

0 'SHIELD BLOCK'~
SHIELD BLOCK~
SHIELD BLOCK is a form of PARRY, but with a shield instead of a
weapon. Characters without the shield block skill will not defend
themselves as well with a shield as will one who has SHIELD BLOCK.
All classes may learn SHIELD BLOCK, but Warriors and Clerics are best
skilled at it. Beware however, flail type weapons ignore shield block
attempts, while shield blocking is less effective against whip type
weapons. Axes have a chance of destroying shields.
 
To use SHIELD BLOCK, you must practice the SHIELD BLOCK skill.
SHIELD BLOCK is automatic once practiced.
~

0 'SHIELD LEVITATE' 'LEVITATE'~
SHIELD LEVITATE~
Using the superior control of their minds developed from years of

wield multiple weapons or spell components while being able to levitate
a shield before them.  
~

ranks of mages and clerics wandering the land.  They require great
amounts of energy and can be very devastating.  The following spells
are included in this group and are listed in order of strength:

{2        Acid{7shield      Surrounds target with a wall of acidic rain
{^        Ice{7shield       Surrounds target with a thick shell of ice{0
{!        Fire{7shield      Surrounds target with a flaming inferno{0

~

0 'THIEF' 'THIEF BASICS' 'THIEF DEFAULT'~
THIEVES~
Thieves are a marginal class. They do few things better than any
other class, but have the widest range of skills available.  Thieves
are specialists at thievery and covert actions, being capable of
entering areas undetected where more powerful adventurers would fear
to tread.  They are better fighters than clerics, but lack the wide
weapon selection of warriors.

All thieves begin with the dagger combat skill, and are learned in
steal as well.  Any other weapon skills must be purchased, unless the
default selection is chosen.  This default skill package includes:

skills:
mace           the use of maces and other blunt weapons
sword          swordplay and fencing
backstab       the art of hitting your opponent by surprise
disarm         used to deprive your opponent of his weapon
dodge          the best way to take a punch is not to be there
second attack  with training, the skilled thief can hit twice as fast
trip           a good way to introduce an opponent to the floor
hide           the art of remaining undetected in a room
peek           used to look into a person's belongings
pick lock      a useful skill for breaking and entering
sneak          with this skill, a thief can walk into a room undetected
~

0 'THIRD ATTACK'~
THIRD ATTACK~
Training in third attack allows the character a chance at an additional
strike in a combat, and increases the chance of a second attack as well.
Perfect third attack does NOT assure three attacks per round.  Only
warriors, rangers, and highly skilled thieves may learn this skill.
~

0 'THORNSHIELD'~
THORNSHIELD~
Syntax: cast 'thornshield' <target>
 
This spell when cast upon you calls forth thorns to harm your opponent
during battle.
~

0 'TICK'~
TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including
combat, most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration,
spell duration, weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called
the 'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the
actual amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area;
less often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on
the ground will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it
resets.
~

0 'TIER' 'CLASSES'~
TIER CLASSES~
{7  First Tier classes:   Second Tier classes:   Third Tier classes:

Each tier's classes are notably stronger than the previous tier's
classes. You cannot REROLL to the next tier until you reach HERO
level (101) in your current tier class. See HELP REROLL.
When advancing to the next tier, you may be ANY class of the tier you
are advancing to. I.E. rerolling to Second Tier or Third Tier,
be any Second Tier or Third Tier class you desire.
~

0 'TITLE'~
TITLE~
Syntax: title <string>

Sets your title to a given string.

The game supplies a title when your character is created and when you
advance a level.  You can use TITLE to set your title to something else.
~

0 'TRACK'~
TRACK~
This is a Ranger/Strider skill.  This skill helps the player by
making it possible to follow a mob/player.  This skill is very useful in
finding mobs/players when they flee from you.  It only works if the
mob/player is a few rooms away from you.
~

0 'TRAIN'~
TRAIN~
Syntax: train <str int wis dex con hp mana>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class, and several
initial training sessions.  You can increase your attributes by
using these sessions at a trainer (there are several in town).

It takes one training session to improve an attribute, or to increase
mana or hp by 10.  You receive one session per level.

The best attributes to train first are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more
practice when you gain a level.  CON gives you more hit points.
In the long run, your character will be most powerful if you train
WIS and CON both to 18 before practising or training anything else.
~

104 'TRANSFER' 'TELEPORT~
TRANSFER~
Syntax: transfer <character>
	transfer all
	transfer <character> <location>
	transfer all         <location>

Transfer transfers the target character, or ALL player characters,
to your current location (default) or to a specified location. Trans all 
should almost never be used, as 100 players popping into one room can
have horrible effects on slow links. Teleport is a synonym for transfer. 
~

0 'TRANSPORT'~
TRANSPORT~
Usage: cast transport <object> <victim>

TRANSPORT sends a specified object from your inventory to another
players inventory (victim). To turn off the ability to receive
transports, type NOTRAN.
~

0 'TRANSPORTATION'~

attack and kill a player with the twit flag, whether they can normally
pkill or not.

PARDON will remove the Twit flag if set.

0 'VAMPIRE' 'VAMPIRE BASICS' 'VAMPIRE DEFAULT'~
VAMPIRICSHIELD~
Vampires are killers.  They aren't truly alive in the sense that most
mortals are, but are rather undead, not really subject to withering of
old age or the fading of the mind that those who are truly alive find
themselves subject to.  As a result vampires are long lived, and almost
all of them eventually go insane.  They are very much like thieves, but
possess very potent powers of magic.

Vampires are not really a class in the traditional since, as many don't
choose to be what they are, and their powers are not the result of education
and training, but of undead nature.

skills:
backstab        the art of hitting your opponent by surprise
disarm          used to deprive your opponent of his weapon
dodge           the best way to take a punch is not to be there
shield block    the art of parrying with a shield
sneak           with this skill, a vampire can walk into a room undetected

spell groups:
beguiling       spells that control the mind
detection       informational magics, such as detect magic and identify
enhancement     spells that maximize physical potential, such as haste
illusion        magics for concealing and deceiving
maledictions    a selection of curses fit for any witch

priests in the church, but at a hefty price.

After the successful use of a voodoo doll, your victim will be immune
to the effects of another use for 1 tick.

0 'WARRIOR' 'WARRIOR BASICS' 'WARRIOR DEFAULT'~

Warriors live for combat and the thrill of battle. They are the best
fighters of all the classes, but lack the subtle skills of thieves and

might be called for.

the default skill package, which includes the following:

specified string, however the long description and keywords remain the
same. This means restrung sword would still have to be interacted with
using the sword keyword, not the restrung name.

{3PRETITLE{7 is a command that lets you assign a title before your name.
The pretitle will appear before your name on who, most channels, finger,
and most actions. Pretitles currently have no string limit, but if they are
abused this will be revoked.

spell groups. They are also very skilled at the use of magical items,
though their combat skills are the weakest of any class.
 
Wizards make great allies to bands of fighters. With the fighters doing
the up close hand to hand combat, Wizards can help obliterate enemies
via casting their range of offensive spells to help make the enemy
less effective in combat, thus making them more likely to die.
