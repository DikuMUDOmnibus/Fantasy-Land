Name ALIGNMENT~
Keyw 'ALIGN' 'ALIGNMENT'~
Text
Alignment is an expression of your attitudes on life and how you react 
to situations.There's good, neutral, and evil alignments.  Your align-
ment is affected by the alignment of the foes you kill; kill an evil 
monster and your alignment shifts towards good, kill a good one, and
you head towards the dark side of things.
 
Alignment is expressed in numbers from 1000 (pure good) to -1000 (pure
evil), with 0 being true neutral. Most creatures are neither wholly
evil nor wholly good and have alignment scores between 500 and -500. 
You can check your alignment by typing SCORE. Spells such as DETECT
GOOD, DETECT EVIL, and KNOW ALIGNMENT will show you the alignment
of mobs and other players.
 
Alignment affects what equipment you may wear, weapons you may use, how
creatures react to you, experience gained, and, sometimes, what exits
you see.  The Temple of Alton houses recall for good and high-neutral
aligned characters.  The Temple of Shryp is home to those of evil and
low-neutral alignment.  Equipment that is not suited to your alignment
will be "zapped" off of you when you try to wear it. If you are of good
alignment, on occasion, Alton will protect you from harm in battle
(usually from teleport spells), but Shryp, being evil, leaves his
followers to fend for themselves.
 
 
If you wish to change your alignment in some way other than fighting
oppositely-aligned foes, you will pay dearly.  Go to the church in
town near Clan Road and either REPENT ALIGN or CURSE ALIGN at the
appropriate priest for the alignment you wish to become.

enchanting spell groups. They are also very skilled at the use of
magical items, though their combat skills are the weakest of any class.

Apprentices make great allies to bands of fighters. With the fighters
doing the up close hand to hand combat, Apprentices can help obliterate
enemies via casting their range of offensive spells to help make the
enemy less effective in combat, thus making them more likely to die.

Morting: At this time, if you feel the desire, you may want to play

{w         However, do not overlook the purpose of building. Once we get
         sufficient amount of areas built, we may open to the public 
         providing them with almost any option for equipment possible.
 
As always, enjoy the game and have fun. Any problems or concerns, feel
free to note Alton, or speak with Alton and they will be addressed. If
you have any ideas, in which you wanted to see on other muds and they 
couldn't code them, feel free to post them, I'm sure we can work

Name CALM~
Keyw 'CALM'~
Text
Syntax: cast 'calm' 

One of the most useful and often overlooked abilities of the master
cleric is the calm spell, which can put an end to all violence in a
room.  Calmed creatures will not attack of their own volition, and
are at a disadvantage in combat as long as the spell soothes their
minds.  The more violence activity there is in a room, the harder the
spell, and it is all or nothing -- either all combat in the room is
ended (with the exception of those who are immune to magic) or none is.

Name CAST~
Keyw 'CAST'~
Text
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you
practice, the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting
spells costs mana. The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell
name. Example: cast 'cure crit' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-
word spells. You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the target usually gets a saving
throw. The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the target
makes the saving throw successfully.

Clerics are the most defensively orientated of all classes.  Most of
their spells focus on healing or defending the faithful, with their few
combat spells being far less powerful than those of mages. However,
clerics are the best class by far at healing magics, and possess an
impressive array of protective magics, as well as fair combat prowess.

All clerics begin with skill in the mace.  Other weapon or shield
skills must be purchased, many at a very dear cost.  The default
skill selection for clerics is as follows:

skills:
flail          the proper use of flails

spell groups:
attack         a selection of offensive magics
creation       the making of physical objects, such as food and water
curative       spells that cure the sick and feeble of their ailments
benedictions   powerful magics that grant the blessings of the gods
detection      informational magics, such as detect magic and identify
healing        spells for healing wounds, from scratches to death blows
maledictions   an assortment of curses

Name COMPOSING MUSIC~
Keyw 'COMPOSING' 'COMPOSITION'~
Text
The note scale used ranges from {qA{w-{qZ{w, since its a magical one.

The notes {yA{w-{yM{w add damage.
The notes {yN{w-{yZ{w multiply damage.

Each note from {yA{w-{yM{w causes a specific type of damage and has a specific
partner damage multiplier note({yN{w-{yZ{w). Therefore there are 13 damage types
that can be used independently or combined in a music piece.
 
Each note pair has a "value" which is part of the "lucky number 14 rule".
{RNote:{w these values are not directly related to the damage caused by the
note - their only use is in the lucky 14 rule which will be explained.
 
This table summarises the relationships:
 
{B+---------------------+----------------------------------------+
{B| {w({R+{w) damage note     {B|{y A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J  K  L  M  {B|
{B| {w({Rx{w) damage note     {B|{y N  O  P  Q  R  S  T  U  V  W  X  Y  Z  {B|
{B| {YLucky{w-{R14{w-{Yrule{w value {B|{y 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13 {B|
{B+---------------------+----------------------------------------+{x
 
The {ydifficulty value{w of the piece determines how powerful an instrument
needs to be to play it and also how much {ydamage{w is caused, since its
factored into the damage calculations. Therefore it is preferable to have
the highest difficulty possible to get the most damage. The {ydownside{w of
having a high difficulty, however, is that the closer the difficulty is to
your instrument level (it has to be below or equal to even work), the less
chance there is of the music being successful.
 
The difficulty value is calculated as per this formula:

{yDifficulty {w= {w({y2{R^{yNumber of notes{w + {yNote weight(see below){w)
{w             --------------------------------------------
{y                    2{R^{yNumber of {Ylucky{y-{R14{ys{y achieved{x
 
{RNote:{w the "{R^{w" stands for "to-the-power-of", as in {y2^3{w is two cubed. 
 
The {ynote weight{w for notes {yA{w-{yM{w = {R+{y2{w per note added.
The {ynote weight{w for notes {yN{w-{yZ{w = Note weight {Rx {y1.5{w per note added (at the end)
and only if the multiplication is successful.
 
As explained above, the {ymultiplier{w note only multiplies damage for their
partner notes' damtypes. {RThey do not ADD damage by themselves{w. This means
that you have to add damage using the {y+{w damage note before you should use
the multiplier note.

There are two rules to the damage multipliers:

{y1.{w Each multiplier note, {yN{w-{yZ{w, may be used to effect only once in a piece.
 
{y2.{w The {y+{w damage partner of the multiplier note needs to be the predominant
one in the music piece {RAT THE POSITION{w of the multiplier note. This means
you can have different types of multipliers in one piece, just as long as
the notes are arranged so that the partner notes of the multiplier notes
are predominant by the time the multiplier note is used. 
 
{RNote:{w if either rule 1 or rule 2 is broken during composition, the note
multiplier concerned will not be successful and will not count in the note
weight value, however it will still be counted in the total number of notes
(see the formula above). Therefore its good to check that you haven't
broken these rules as its not productive.
 
{RAnother note:{w The damage multipliers are only added at the end, so partner
damage notes added after the damage multiplier will still have their
damages multiplied, but will {rnot{w be included in the check to see whether
the specific note type is the predominant one, but of course, can still
affect the checks of other multiplier notes after the concerned notes.
 
The {Ylucky {R14 {wrule is not that high in priorities as the other rules,
however it can help extend your pieces, allowing more damage types to be
used and getting the most damage out of your instrument for the same
difficulty. It requires the use of the values in the table above. 
To take advantage of the rule, you should arrange your notes so that
consecutive notes add up to {y14{w (use the values in the table above). The
count is done as a "rolling" count, meaning notes can be included in more
than one group and the groups can start anywhere, not just the beginning of
the piece and at the end of a previous group (see the example below).
 
An example:{y C C C P B H H{w
{wNote value: {y3 3 3 3 2 6 6
{B            <------->
{R               14{B   <--->
{R                     14{w

As you can see, note {yB{w is used in two groups. Using the formula above, the
overall difficulty is divided by {y2{R^{y2 {w= {y4{w, allowing around 2-3 extra notes
to be put into the piece.
 
{RNote:{w As shown in the formula, the reduction in difficulty is only applied
at the end, so the difficulty value you are reducing with this rule is the
one including the extra notes you add due to the reduction caused.

Being a bard has its perks, but you probably need a brain the size of a
planet to get the most out of it, since this is the main beef of the class.
 
I hope this makes sense - this is my third attempt at writing this.
Note/talk to me ({yZarko{w) if you have any questions.
Please note, I may have made this thing but to be quite honest, I don't
know the best combos - you gotta find em out yourself, though I do know a
few tips if you're good...

Name FAST HEALING~
Keyw 'FAST HEALING'~
Text
The fast healing skill improves wound healing rates, whether walking,
resting, or sleeping. It represents knowledge of healing herbs or just
general toughness and stamina.  Fast healing is checked every tick, and
it is possible for it to fail.  All class may learn this skill, but
mages find it very difficult to master, due to their bookish lifestyle.

Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue   <player>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the
fight is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another
player can RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less 
likely to work, and costs more experience points than fleeing.).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more
experience.

The FLOATING DISC spell creates a disc of floating energy which

caster's equipment list MUST have NOTHING in it, or else this spell
fails. The floating disc holds (10 pounds)x(caster's level), max of
5 pounds per item, lasts just less than 2x(caster's level), and
does not add to caster's items/weight carried. Death, and energy
expiring from the disc are the only 2 ways to lose the disc.

Syntax: follow <player>
Syntax: group
Syntax: group <player>

FOLLOW starts you following another player.  To stop following anyone
else, just FOLLOW <self>.

GROUP <player> makes someone who is following you a member of your
group.  Group members share experience points from kills and may use
the GTELL and SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked,
you will automatically join the fight.

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave
your group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your
group.

You may only GROUP characters who are within 10 levels of your own.

Syntax: cast 'frenzy' <target>

The frenzy spell fills the target with righteous fury, greatly
increasing his or her attack skill and damaging capacity.
Unfortunately, this divine wrath is coupled with a tendency to ignore
threats to personal safety, making the target easier to hit.  Frenzy
provides immunity to the calm spell (see 'help calm'), and may only be
used on those of the caster's alignment.

gain <name>:  add a skill or skill group, at the listed cost
gain convert: turns 6 practices into one training session
gain study:   turns 1 training session into 6 practices

Gain uses training sessions, not practices. (see 'help train')

Usage: cast <{@gate{&|{%portal{&|{#nexus{w> <target>

{@GATE{w creates a one way portal which transports the caster and their
pets through to the target, whom is not more than 3 levels above the 
caster. Other members of the casters group won't be transported. God
rooms, private rooms, and no_recall rooms cannot be gated into, and
no_recall rooms cannot be gated out of. Gods, Heroes, and players with
NOSUMMON toggled on, cannot be gated to. Clan members may not be
gated to by anyone other than fellow clan members.

{%PORTAL{w creates a one way portal to the target, allowing the caster and
others to walk thru to the target. To enter a portal, type ENTER
PORTAL or GO PORTAL. Portals cannot be created to targets in certain
locations, nor be used to escape portal and gate proof rooms. Special
sources of power are required in order to create portals. The secret
of the source however, has been lost in time...
 
{#Nexus{w Is identical to {%PORTAL{w except for one thing, it is a two
way portal, rather than one way. It also lasts longer than {%PORTAL{w.

GOUGE is a great way to attempt to blind your opponent via literally

long, but provides a significant edge in combat. Gouge can be used
to initiate combat, while in combat, and if fighting multiple opponents
can target which opponent gets their eyes gouged. CURE BLINDNESS

Text
The ROT skill system allows you to fully customize your new character,
making him or her skilled in the skills you choose.  But beware, the
skills you pick at character creation are the only skills you will ever
learn.  Skills are paid for with creation points, and the more creation
points you have, the harder it is to gain a level.  Furthermore, higher-
cost skills are harder to practice.

Skill groups are like package deals for characters -- sets of skills or
spells that are closely related, and hence can be learned as a unit.
There is a default skill group for each class, which can be selected for
a balanced selection of skills at a somewhat reduced cost.

The experience breakdown is as follows: 
points   exp/level     points   exp/level
40        1000         90        6000
50        1500         100       8000
60        2000         110      12000
70        3000         120      16000 
80        4000         130      24000
The table continues in a similar manner for higher point totals.

These sorcerous spells are, in the words of one famous mage, just
'more ways to toss energy around'.  They are the most powerful of
the damaging spells, and considered an essential part of most wizards'
collections. Clerics and thieves do not have access to these spells.
In order of power, the combat spell group contains the following magics:

magic missile   send a weak energy bolt into a foe
chill touch     weakens your enemy with a frigid grasp
burning hands   sends a blast of fire into your foe
shocking grasp  sends a powerful jolt into a foe
lightning bolt  sends forth a single bolt of lightning into an enemy
colour spray    blasts your target w/rainbow spray, which may blind 
fireball        a powerful spell, great for burning your enemy to ashes
acid blast      sends forth a stream of acid to eradicate your foes
chain lightning sends lightning bolts arcing through foes

Name IMMORTALS~
Keyw 'IMMORTAL' 'GOD' 'WIZ'~
Text
'Immortal' (often, simply, 'immort') refers to players who have reached
the highest attainable levels in the game.  Here, anyone of level 102
or higher is an 'immortal.'  Immortals are capable of exceeding the
usual game rules, in more drastic and pervasive ways as levels increase;
examples range from teleportation and invisibility to mortal sight to
creation of objects, removal of a player's privileges (channels,
ability to move, or even ability to log in), and ability to promote
players to immortality.

Since immortals can wreak havoc with game balance, they are (ideally)
a carefully-chosen and policed group.  An absolute rule of immortal
behavior is that no immortal can aid or assist any player without
explicit permission from the higher ranks; in other words, please
don't ask an immortal to help you kill a mob, gather EQ, etc, or
you'll likely be either politely or rudely refused, or referred to
this file.

The duties of immortals, and even the very reasons for their existence,
are topics of continual and heated debate in many MUD forums, and are
fraught with misconceptions, poor examples, and outrageous hypocrisies. :)

Name LORE~
Keyw 'LORE'~
Text
Usage: Lore <object>

Lore is a general skill which utilizes knowledge of myths and legends.
Use of the lore skill gives a chance of obtaining information on an
object, concerning its power and uses.  It may occasionally increase
the value of an object, because more will be known about its worth.
All classes may learn lore, although thieves are best at it, and
warriors find it very hard to use.

Name MAGES~
Keyw 'MAGE' 'MAGIC-USER' 'MAGE BASICS' 'MAGE DEFAULT'~
Text
Mages specialize in the casting of spells, offensive ones in
particular. Mages have the highest-powered magic of any other class
of it's level, and the only one able to use draconian and enchanting
spell groups. They are also very skilled at the use of magical items,
though their combat skills are the weakest of any class.

Mages make great allies to bands of fighters. With the fighters doing
the up close hand to hand combat, Mages can help obliterate enemies
via casting their range of offensive spells to help make the enemy
less effective in combat, thus making them more likely to die.

    mobiles. You can give the mobiles level 100 stats.
*** A couple thousand hp here or there doesn't really matter, but try to keep

*** Do NOT go over 30k hp on a mobile.
*** You might consider give these mobs on this list a couple more levels

Thief* mobiles should read their hp, ac, and damage at one level lower
Mage mobiles read hp and ac at one level lower, and damage three levels lower
Cleric mobiles read damage at two levels lower
Warrior mobiles read hit points one level higher

represented in the MOBprograms by using a dollar sign convention as
in the socials. When the mud command is processed, these variables are
expanded into the values shown below. Usually, it is best to use the
short descriptions of mobiles and the names of players when speaking
them, but if you are performing an action to someone almost always you
want the name. The title field for players is an extra that probably wont
often be used.  Without further hesitation... the variables:

$i      the first of the names of the mobile itself.
$I      the short description of the mobile itself.
$n      the name of whomever caused the trigger to happen.
$N      the name and title of whomever caused the trigger to happen.
$t      the name of a secondary character target (i.e A smiles at B)
$T      the short description, or name and title of target (NPC vs PC)
$r      the name of a random PC in the room with the mobile
$R      the short description, or name and title of the random PC
$q      the name of the MOBprogram target (see MOB REMEMBER)
$Q      the short description of the MOBprogram target

$j      he,she,it based on sex of $i.

$O      the short description of the primary object
$p      the first of the names of the secondary object
$P      the short description of the secondary object

        Also, in if_checks, the accepted variables are the basic ones
(i,n,t,r,o,p,q).  If a variable is referenced that doesn't exist, then
the value is simply left blank or replaced with "someone"/"something"

{DThe way average damage works is based off the level of the weapon. 
Max damage is level + level/10. Min damage is level - level/10. So
Example level 100 weapon, max average is 100 + 100/10, which is 100+10
so 110, where the min is 90. Two-handers would be lvl*1.3.

Cost:
The cost of equipment is broken down as follows.
For a cost between level*401 - level*500 = 15 points
For a cost between level*301 - level*400 = 10 points
For a cost between level*201 - level*300 = 5 points
For a cost between level*101 - level*200 = 3 points
For a cost between level*1 - level*100 = 0 points
 
So hero eq paying 15 points can get a cost between. 40501-50500. Which
equals about 4-5 plat.
Remember I approve areas first, so if high cost eq is on easy mobs or
shit like that, guess you wasted your time :)

When making mobiles, some things to remember, don't make level 40
mobs have hero eq.  And don't make hero mobs have level 40 eq. 
Basically for mobiles, you can build the mobile around the equipment
that you intend the area to house.  So if the eq is level 50, have the
mobiles around 55-75.  Basically the equipment level + 5-25.  So hero eq
will have mobs at level 126.  For the hp...  Mana and affects.  Be
reasonable I'll prol make some charts here soon, But if you want to test
out experience, or how hard mobiles are let me know...  We'll do that.. 
After the whole area is revised cause that'll be the last part.  
 
For mob levels 20-100. The stats are picked by the level of the
mobile.
Three different types of mobs. Easy/Medium/Hard. For easy mobiles.
there will be different formulas to follow.
Hitdice/Damdice/Manadice will work like this.
The first die + the second die must = the level of the mobile
with the first die being greater than the second for med/hard mobs
the first die must be less than the second for easy mobs.

The values will be 1/3 the level of the object. So a hero item will have
a value of 33 across, it will be the same for lvl 99 100 and 101 eq. In
the event you want to do less you may, if you take values away from one 
you may put half what you take away to another value.
 
So example would be level 99 piece of eq, 33 33 33 33 would be the stats
however you want the first to be only 23, well you took 10 away, so you 
can now add half of that, which is 5 to another value, making the piece
potentially 23 38 33 33.
 
You can mix and match if you like as well, just don't go over half of 
what you took away. So same values the first being 23, so can add 5, you
can do something like 23 35 34 34. The other values combined is only 5
over which is within what you took away parameters making it legit.

ROM started in early February 1993, using Merc 1.0 code. In July of
1993, ROM II was started, eventually replacing the original ROM.  ROM
was up for a little over a year, after which the code (version 2.3)
was released, and various other ROM muds were started, including
Rivers of Mud under a new management (Zump's ROM), at rom.org 9000.

Alander's current project is Tesseract, the latest version of the ROM
code.  It can be found at hypercube.org 9000.

The following people contributed to the ROM flavor of the merc base
code:

Socials --
    Kelsey and Liralen

New, Improved Valhalla --
    Liralen

Puff's new special proc and improved poofin/poofout code --
    Seth

Maps and map shop --
    Ezra, Regnan (Olympus)

Nirvana zone --
    Forstall (mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Mob Factory --
    Pinkfloyd (originally written for ROM, mobiles rewritten by
               Alander)

Geographically correct Midgaard (tm) --
    Alander

Ideas and playtesting --
    Thousands of dedicated mudders around the world

Beta testing --
    Ken Blosser, Doug Araya, and Sherene Neil all helped with bug
    reports and suggestions, saving a lot of headaches

New Thalos area was donated by Onivel of Jedi, who was also the
originator of the ASCII flags used in the zone files

ROM 2.4 was developed during my time with Moosehead mud, and the
release shares many of the features I wrote while I was there.
Additional code was written by Seth Scott (the new poofin/poofout),
and many contributions and ideas from the Merc list were used. 

The new features of 2.4 were largely produced in bull sessions with
Gabrielle (my wife) and Brian Moore, without whom this release
wouldn't have happened.  In particular, the new privacy code,
furniture, and wiznet are largely the results of Gabrielle's ideas.

Changes to the standard diku mob and object format, as well as the
changes to Merc 2.1 source code, were done by Alander over many a late
night of hair-pulling. Hope you enjoy it.

The FARSIGHT spell heightens the caster's awareness, thus allowing
creatures and players in adjacent rooms they SCAN to show up in
their real identity. If a specified direction is scanned however, 
occupants will be revealed up to a few rooms away in that direction.
Since much concentration is needed for such talent, the caster

Name TICK~

Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including
combat, most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration,
spell duration, weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called
the 'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the
actual amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area;
less often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on
the ground will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it
resets.

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your

using these sessions at a trainer (there are several in town).

It takes one training session to improve an attribute, or to increase

The best attributes to train first are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more
practice when you gain a level.  CON gives you more hit points.

all of them eventually go insane.  They are very much like thieves, but
possess very potent powers of magic.
